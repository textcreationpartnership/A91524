            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE firſt occaſion of theſe meditations upon theſe words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to his Diſciples, <hi>(John 14.1.)</hi> is known only to my ſelf and another perſon whoſe contentment I exceedingly deſired. But the occaſion of their publication is known to more
<pb facs="tcp:170387:3"/>then your ſelves, (for whoſe uſe they were firſt tranſcribed a good while ago) which I will not trouble the world ſo much as to take an account of. For it will believe (its like) that it comes from my own proper motion and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to ſend them abroad: and the ordinary reaſon from the importunity of friends can be underſtood by none but thoſe who know that a friend can do more with us then we our ſelves.</p>
            <p>But the reaſon why they addreſs themſelves to you, is known beſt to my ſelf. For though you might know it if you pleaſed, yet your goodneſs teaches you to forget the many obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions you laid upon me, which I ought alwayes to remember. So many they are that when I think how to diſcharge them, it puts me in mind that there is one ſort of trouble which I have made no proviſion againſt in this Treatiſe, which is for want of ability both to pay what we owe to thoſe that love us, and alſo to expreſs the ſenſe which we have of their goodneſs. But I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that this is ſuch a pleaſing ſort of trouble that one would not be willing that it ſhould be cured. We have no
<pb facs="tcp:170387:3"/>reaſon to find fault that our friends will do us more good then we deſerve, nor to complain that their goodneſs is greater then we can ſpeak of. And that ought not (I know) to be the occaſion of my trouble, which is your ſingular pleaſure aad contentment. And if this kind of acknowledgement will acquit me in any ſort of ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, I am but beginning to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge and exonerate my ſelf: For I had deſigned, before the publiſhing of this was thought of, to put a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of another nature into your hands. But I am well ſecured that I ſhall not trouble you by beginning my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to you with a diſcourſe of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as if I did bode ſome evil to you, becauſe I believe that you deſire rather to be prepared againſt any croſſes, then to have none befall you. I confeſs I diſcern ſome defects in the firſt part of this Treatiſe, which if I had penned with an intention to have ſent abroad, I think that I ſhould have taken ſome care to have ſeen ſupplied. But it will not be the leſs aceptable to you who are able I know out of the general truths here propounded, to raiſe ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:170387:4"/>principles as will be able to give you ſatisfaction in particular caſes not here named. Yet preſuming that you will not be weary of reading any thing that comes from the hand of one whom you love ſo well, I ſhall here take the liberty to inſtance in ſome things which would have deſerved ſome particular conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>There is no greater trouble to ſome ingenuous ſouls then to be requited with injuries for the kindneſſes they have done to others. But they may ſoon conſider that this befell our Maſter Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. And though it be in their power to do good to others, yet it belongs not to them to make them good. And if there be any way to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get love in them, it is by love: and there is no ſmall contentment in loving thoſe who have no love for us. For this is the very height of love, and love it ſelf is a thing ſo ſweet that it is its own reward.</p>
            <p>But ſome perhaps have this addition of trouble that their own friends do not love them; and thoſe whom God and nature do command to be kind, are ill affected towards them. The ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
<pb facs="tcp:170387:4"/>will cure this diſeaſe. And let them turn their love into pitty, that any ſhould be ſo unhappy as to be ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the rareſt pleaſures in the world which ariſe from loving of others. And you may ſee from hence the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of one Rule which I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, which is <hi>not to hope for any thing here below.</hi> And particularly remember this, that you may be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed if you look for any more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from your children, <hi>then the pleaſure of doing good to them, and ſeeing them do good to themſelves.</hi> For the old ſaying hath had but few hitherto to croſs it, <hi>That love (like your inheritances) doth deſcend, but uſeth not to aſcend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there are others that may ſay they could eaſily brook any ſufferings from others, but that commonly it is the lot of thoſe that ſuffer, to be thought guilty of thoſe crimes for which they innocently ſuffer. <hi>Quae perferunt, meruiſſe creduntur.</hi> The world is ſo ſottiſh that they commonly think men deſerve that which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; and we are deprived many times not only of our enjoyments, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb facs="tcp:170387:5"/>of our fame; and we are denyed not only our ſecurity, but likewiſe all apology for our ſelves. But who can keep the world from thinking what they pleaſe? Who knows not that it ſees but with half an eye, if it be not ſtark blind? And what ſhall we be the better if they think well of us, ſeeing what they think either one way or other, is with ſo little reaſon. If we deſerve not well, their thoughts and ſpeeches can do us no good; and if we do, God will take care that they ſhall do us no harm.</p>
            <p>But there is a little number of good ſouls perhaps who are troubled for what others ſuffer, and are afflicted with the miſery of their neighbours. There are ſo few that complain of this grief, and it is a malady that men are ſo ſeldom ſick of, that I ſhould ſcarce have thought it needfull to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed any Phyſick for ſuch a rare diſeaſe. If the hurt do not touch us in our own bodies, relations or friends, we ſhall ſoon find comfort enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any direction to alleviate the grief which we ſuſtain for others how hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy ſoever it may happen to be. But
<pb facs="tcp:170387:5"/>if any be oppreſſed with this ſort of trouble, Let them conſider what is ſaid in the enſuing Treatiſe, that they do others no good, but themſelves harm by being troubled. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let-them be ſenſible of their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſo far only as to pray for them, and relieve them (if they can) and to make their hearts ſenſible of Gods mercies to them, that by that joy they may cure the other trouble.</p>
            <p>But men are troubled perhaps that Religion is like to ſuffer. I am very glad of it if they be; for then I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch perſons are ſo much in love with Religion, that they will not let their trouble hinder any part of their duty. And if they do their duty, they may leave it to God to have a care of the intereſt of Religion; for he loves it far better then we can do.</p>
            <p>But ſome are troubed that they are no more troubled. A ſad thing that we ſhould be diſcontented at that, for which we ſhould be thankfull. For by this trouble they moan nothing elſe but a confuſedneſs of ſpirit which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did any body any good. The rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
<pb facs="tcp:170387:6"/>of the eyes doth not fetch out the moat, but makes them more red and angry; no more doth this diſtraction and fretting of the mind, diſcharge it of any ill humours, but rather makes them more abound to vex us.</p>
            <p>But ſome are yet troubled becauſe they fall from the height of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and are more troubled now then once they were at what befalls them. Whereas they once obſerved theſe rules well and kept themſelves in peace, they fall now into ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content again; Whereas they did pray with ſome fervour, they now abate of the height of their Zeal. Truly we muſt not expect while we are here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in this Cave or Dungeon, to be quite free from all ſuch damps. And it may be ſome degree of pride, not to be able to endure ſome dulneſs and coldneſs of ſpirit. Be not troubled if at all times you cannot do as well as you would, but labour to do as well as you can. And eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take heed that the not doing of what you did, do not breed in you a fearfulneſs that you ſhall never do as you was wont again. This diſpirits the
<pb facs="tcp:170387:6"/>ſoul and ſo diſheartens it, that it runs it ſelf into that very thing which it is taking a courſe for to avoid.</p>
            <p>Remember well that rule which is the firſt that you meet-withall in the the following book. <hi>Know your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thoroughly and then do it.</hi> If you think it to be leſs then it is, you will not do what you ought; and if you think it to be more then it is, you cannot do what you think you ought: and if you think that anxiety of mind for what is not in your preſent power, is any part of your duty, you do not think as you ought. There was a great Maſter among the Jews who bid his Schollars conſider and tell him what was the beſt way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a man ſhould alwayes keep;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>R. Jocho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan in Pirke Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voth. L.</hi> 2.</note> One came and ſaid that there was nothing better then a <hi>good eye,</hi> which is in their language a liberal and contented diſpoſition. Another ſaid A good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion is the beſt thing in the world. A third ſaid A good neighbour was the beſt thing he could deſire; and a fourth preferred a man that could foreſee things to come, <hi>i. e.</hi> a wiſe perſon. But at laſt came in one <hi>Eleazar</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:170387:7"/>he ſaid <hi>A good heart</hi> was better then them all. True ſaid the Maſter, thou haſt comprehended in two words all that the reſt have ſaid. For he that hath a good heart will, be both contented, and a good companion, and a good neighbour, and eaſily ſee what is fit to be done by him. Let every man then ſeriouſly labour to find in himſelf a ſincerity and uprightneſs of heart at all times, and that will ſave him abundance of other labour.</p>
            <p>But let me take upon me to be ſo far a Maſter as to tell you, that next to this man the ſecond ſaid right, that a <hi>good friend</hi> is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eaſement in the world in this ſort of troubles.</p>
            <p>If a man therefore cannot quiet himſelf, let him get a good friend to whom he may unboſome his heart; for two (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) are better then one: becauſe if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow.</p>
            <p>Two ſmall ſtreams united in one channell, may be able to bear a veſſel of ſome burden: and ſo may the counſels and comforts of two friends meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether be able to ſupport the weight of many troubles.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170387:7"/>
            <p>But if one will reſolve to be troubled, I ſee there is no end of it; for a man may be diſquieted in his thoughts about the choice of ſuch a friend.</p>
            <p>Let ſuch conſider this, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps God hath given them one alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the perſon that lies in their arms may give the beſt advice unto them. Or their ſpiritual Guide may be the moſt excellent friend. Or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they may know who will make one, by their love to piety, by the ſimplicity of their manners, the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and modeſty of their converſe, their wiſe diſcourſe, their freedom from pride and captiouſneſs and ſuch like things. This likewiſe I may add that though there be an inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity between that perſon and you, which is a neceſſary thing to friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, yet if other things be not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, love and friendſhip will make you equal.</p>
            <p>But how if this friend ſhould die, will ſome ſay, how much then ſhall I be troubled? and what remedy ſhall I uſe to give me comfort when I have loſt him that ſhould comfort me! I told you there was no end of Queſtions,
<pb facs="tcp:170387:8"/>But yet the reſolution of this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion will ſatisfie all; for he that can bear this trouble, will be able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himſelf under all other. And therefore ſince I reſolved to let theſe meditations go further then your ſelves; I have compoſed a little Tract to wait upon them, which adminiſters comforts againſt the loſs of friends. It hath indeed contrary to my firſt deſign out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown that in bigneſs which was born above two years before it: But yet the reaſon may be becauſe there is much of the other in it. For as it is in the Calculations of our Almanacks which are referred exactly to ſome certain place, but fit without ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible error the whole Nation; So I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it is in this diſcourſe, which though it doth moſt properly belong to thoſe who have loſt their friends, yet hath many things in it which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently ſerve all other perſons who are troubled about worldly matters. And let me intreat you and all others that read me, to remember alwayes, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:170387:8"/>give you much ſatisfaction in your hearts. He hath made all theſe things mutable, and therefore it is a <hi>madneſs</hi> to think that they alwayes ſtand as we would have them: and yet he is ſo good that he hath made ſomething good for us in every mutation, ſo that it is a <hi>Folly</hi> to be diſcontented that they continue not as we would have them. Who would go and ſeek for Violets and Primroſes in the Wood in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeaſon? But then we may go and gather ſticks to keep us warm. And in the Spring who looks for Grapes and Plums and ſuch ripe fruit? But yet we may prune the Vines and lopp the Trees, and wait a while and have what we deſire. Aſſure your ſelves it is forgetfulneſs of God that makes us troubled, yea forgetfulneſs of our ſelves alſo, who think we have loſt our proper good, when we are well enough. And I think it will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>become me to ſpeak to you in the words of a Heathen, and bid you <hi>Be confident,

            </p>
            <p>And yet upon a review of what I have writ concerning our friends death, I think that there is one ſort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that would have deſerved a more particular conſideration then I have given them in that diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Widdows I mean, who eſteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo deſolate that I ought to have pittied them ſo much as to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed a few lines on purpoſe unto their comfort. Though I do not know how to excuſe my ſelf if here I ſhould enter upon that ſubject; Yet there is a great perſon who hath ſpoken words of conſolation to them ſo excellently ſweet, that it cannot diſpleaſe you if I give you the ſenſe of what <hi>He</hi> ſaith. I have loſt (ſaith ſome ſad ſoul) not only my companion,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Chryſoſt.</hi> upon 1 <hi>Theſ. Hom.</hi> 6.</note> but my guide, my ſtay, my ſhield, my ſecond ſelf. I doubt not of the reſurrection which
<pb facs="tcp:170387:9"/>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> diſcourſes of; but what ſhall I do in the mean time? Much buſineſs I have to do: but I am a fit prey for every Cormorant who hath a mind to be unjuſt. The Servants who reverenced me before, will now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe a ſilly woman. If my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band have obliged any: alas! it will be ſoon forgotten now that he can do them no more kindneſs; but if he did them any wrong, they will be ſure to take all the revenge upon me that they are able. This is the thing that breeds me all my anguiſh; and ſet this aſide, his death would not ſo much trouble me.</p>
            <p>What ſhall we anſwer? (ſaith Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> unto this.) Truly I could eaſily convince them that not what they pretend, but an unreaſonable paſſion is the cauſe of words ſo ſad and dolefull: If this were the cauſe of their lamentation, then they muſt never ceaſe thus to bewail themſelves. But if after a years time all theſe tears are dried up, then the want of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and comfort which will be then moſt ſenſible, is not the only cauſe of them. But let it be ſuppoſed that
<pb facs="tcp:170387:10"/>this is the fountain of all their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and conſider how much infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity there is in it, that we ſhould think it is <hi>They</hi> that take care of us and not <hi>God:</hi> It cannot chuſe but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to anger to ſee that a creature of his is more beloved then himſelf; and therefore it is likely he took away thy husband becauſe he was more to thee then thy God himſelf. The holy one of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is very jealous, and cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be ſo ſlighted, that other things ſhould have as much of our affections as his excellent goodneſs, which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be beloved by us above all others, becauſe it expreſſes a love to us above all other creatures. What was the reaſon I beſeech you that Widdow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Orphanage were ſo rare in the Ancient times among good people? Why did <hi>Abraham</hi> and his <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> live till a great old age? Truly I think it was becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> loved God more then either of them: and when God did but ſay unto him Kill thy Son, he was as willing to do it as to offer the Sacrifice of a Lamb. But we are heavy and dull; we are carried ſo head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the embraces of creatures,
<pb facs="tcp:170387:10"/>that God is fain even againſt our wills to draw our affections to himſelf by drawing them away from us. Do but love God more then thy husband, and I will undertake that thou ſhalt not fall into Widdowhood, or thou ſhalt not feel it when thou falleſt into it. And I have a good ground for what I avouch: For thou haſt him for thy Husband and thy defence, that never dies, and that loves thee infinitely more then any man can do. And if this reaſon be not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to convince thee, I have a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon that will win thy aſſent. Tell me, if thou hadſt a husband who loved thee ſo much as if he had no ſoul but thine, one that was as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of others as he loved thee; one ſo wiſe and diſcreet that he was as much admired as loved; one ſo gentle and complyant as if he was but wax to thy impreſſions; one by whom thou didſt ſhine as the Moon doth with the rayes of the Sun: and ſuppoſe thou hadſt a child by this dear perſon who dies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he comes to his full age; Wouldſt thou be conſiderately grieved and touched with ſorrow for its death while thou didſt enjoy ſuch a better love?
<pb facs="tcp:170387:11"/>No, in no wiſe. He that is ſo fair and beautifull in thy eyes, would ſupply the want of it as the Sun doth the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Stars. He that is more loved and eſteemed, would obſcure and quite hide all the excellencies of the other. If therefore thou loveſt God more then that husband: if his glory put out the luſtre of all other things in thine eyes, thou wilt be as little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at his death, as before then waſt for the death of thy child. Yea far leſs one would think, ſhould thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble be, in as much as God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more above that Husband, then he above thy child.</p>
            <p>And beſide, what is that thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveſt from thy Husband that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to what the love of God gives thee? Are they not pangs and labours, unkind words perhaps and angry chide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? Or if thou canſt tell me of any goods, what are they? What are fine cloaths and Jewels, and honours and ſuch like things to the Son of God, to the Brotherhood and Adoption, to the Kingdom and eternal glory, to the life of God and Coheirſhip with the only begotten? wilt thou after all this
<pb facs="tcp:170387:11"/>tell me thou canſt not but be paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate for the loſs of thy Husband? If thou wanteſt him, thou haſt God. If thou wanteſt thy menial ſervants and attendants, thou haſt the guard of ſpiritual powers; the dominions and principalities of heaven are thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. If thou ſayeſt thy children want a Father; that cannot be, ſeeing God is the Father of the Fatherleſs. If thou feareſt they ſhall want, tell thy ſelf who gave them to thee, and whether the life be not more then meat, and the body then rayment. Or if thou feareſt they ſhall not be ſo well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided as otherwiſe they would have been; How many could I tell thee of that have been bred by Widdows and proved famous? How many that have had Fathers and been good for nothing? Put the fear of God in their hearts, and this will preſerve them more then a Father. When the Guard is within, they will leſs need one without. This will be better then riches and glory and promotion to them: this will make them famous both in earth and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Do not ſet thine eyes then on the Youth, who by reaſon of his Fathers
<pb facs="tcp:170387:12"/>greanneſs is girded with a golden Belt, and rides on a pranſing Horſe, and is taken into Kings Courts, and hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Maſters and Tutors following him at his heels: But caſt thine eye above, open the gate of heaven in thy thoughts; look into that ſtately Pallace; behold the King there ſitting on his Throne; and if He whom thou ſeeſt on earth can be ſooner admitted thither then thy child; then fetch a great ſigh and fill the heavens with noiſe and clamor. But ſeeing neither riches nor birth nor any thing elſe is there preferred but only vertue and goodneſs, think what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thou haſt to be content: and think how certain it is that nothing is ſad, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> if we will not be fools, but Philoſophers. And for thy ſelf if thou complaineſt of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate and ſolitary: think what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>1 Tim. 5.5.</hi> that ſuch an one <hi>truſteth in God.</hi> This is only an opportunity of enjoying more of God. Thou haſt more time and liberty to pleaſe God now that thou haſt none elſe to pleaſe. Thou art freed from all other bonds, to be tied faſter to him. There are no chains, no reſtraints upon
<pb facs="tcp:170387:12"/>thee to keep thee from doing what thou wouldſt. Thou art ſeparated from one husband, to be united to a better. Thou haſt not the fellow-ſervant, but thou haſt the Maſter. Thou haſt not thy husband to talk with thee, but God is thy husband. When thou prayeſt, doſt <hi>thou</hi> not talk with God? When thou readeſt, tell me, doth not <hi>God</hi> ſpeak to thee? And what doth he ſay to thee? Words more deſirable, more ſweet then can drop from an husbands lips. If he speak never ſo kindly, it is no great matter, for he is but a fellow-ſervant. But if the Maſter will be pleaſed to embrace and ſpeak ſweetly to his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, This is a ſtrange peice of ſervice. And obſerve I beſeech you how he ſerves us and waits upon us: Hear in what words he beſpeaks us. <hi>Come unto me all you that are weary and heavy laden, and you ſhall find reſt to your ſouls.</hi> And again by the Prophet he cryes, <hi>Can a woman forget her ſucking child, that ſhe ſhould not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on the Son of her Womb? yea they may forget, yet I will not forget thee.</hi> What charms and Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trums
<pb facs="tcp:170387:13"/>are there in theſe words? And what can have more of honey in them then theſe expreſſions in the Song of Songs, <hi>My Love, my Dove, my fair one, my Paradiſe,</hi> &amp;c.? and yet this is the language of God to men. To this purpoſe ſpeaks that Divine Perſon with an elegancy, that though I cannot imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, yet I could not but follow till I have run beyond the juſt length of an Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>And yet I cannot but tell you ſome more of my thoughts concerning the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe, though I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged ſo many omiſſions already. There are ſome general rules laid down at the latter end of the firſt Treatiſe, which it would have pleaſed you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps if they had been more inlarged. I ſhall take leave therefore to extend this addreſs a little further; that if it be poſſible, I my not let you want any thing which you may chance to deſire.</p>
            <p>And for direction of your prayers to God in theſe caſes. Be ſure firſt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the cauſe of all your trouble, the fountain which caſts forth the mire and dirt into your fouls. When we know the cauſe of a malady, it is half cured.
<pb facs="tcp:170387:13"/>And ſeeing this cauſe you will find to be within your ſelves, therefore Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Pray not ſo much againſt trouble, as the cauſe of the trouble. Pray for a contented mind, a low eſteem of the world, a new opinion of things, an humble frame of heart and ſuch like graces. If we meerly pray not to be troubled, and reſt in General expreſſions, we ſhall find little eaſe to our hearts. Thirdly, Pray not ſo much for removal of the thing that troubles you, as for ſtrength to bear it, and divine power to ſupport you under it, and heavenly wiſdom to make an advantage of it. Fourthly, If you do pray for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of any outward burden, and the prevention of any loſs, yet let it be with an indifferent mind, leaſt you be more troubled when you find that God doth not hear thoſe prayers. Fifthly, when you are troubled for one fault, be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for all, and pray for a new heart. When you have done any evil, then be humbled for the neglect of ſo much good, which may be the reaſon of that evil. For when a malady doth affect a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular part, the whole body muſt be purged; or elſe if we apply the remedy
<pb facs="tcp:170387:14"/>only to that part, we ſhall but drive the humor to ſome other place. And ſixthly I would wiſh you to apply the remedy preſently before the trouble eat into the fleſh. As ſoon as you ſee it it come, fly to God, and take your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes and beſeech him to bleſs them to you. I cannot but here again tranſcribe another excellent ſpeech of an Heathen. <hi>Either God can do ſomething,
<note place="margin">M. Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin. L. <hi>9. §. 40.</hi>
                  </note> or he cannot: If he can do nothing, why doſt thou pray to him? If he can do ſomething, why doſt thou not pray that thou maiſt not fear, nor deſire, nor be ſad for any of theſe things, rather then that this or that thing ſhould be or not be to thee? If he can help us, then he can help us to be without a thing as well as to have it: and not to fear a thing, as well as not to have it. Begin therefore to beg theſe things of God by prayer, and thou ſhalt ſee what will be the iſſue of it. One prayes that he may have ſuch an one to wife; Do thou pray that thou maiſt not deſire her. Another prayes to be eaſed of a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny; Do thou pray that thou maiſt be able to bear it. O let not my
<pb facs="tcp:170387:14"/>child die, ſaith another; but do thou ſay, O let me not fear the loſs of it. Turn thy prayers I ſay all this way, and ſee what will come of it.</hi> Thus that Royal Philoſopher.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>Faith</hi> which is another thing there mentioned, I intreat you to believe, Firſt, That God is not hard to pleaſe. Perſwade your ſelves that he is good and gratious, and accepts of the ſincere, hearty and conſtant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of his Servants to do his will. Secondly, Believe that he would have us pleaſed too, and delights in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. It is not pleaſing to him to ſee us troubled, nor doth he wiſh to ſee us full of perplexed thoughts N: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he willingly grieve us, or ſend ſuch things upon us that ſhould moleſt us, but he loves to have all his children in peace. And Thirdly, Believe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he hath the greateſt mind to give that which will remedy the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cauſe of troubles, and that is his Divine Grace and Holy Spirit. Sin is that which makes all our ſores ſo angry; The Spirit of the moſt High is that which will enable us to mortifie it; and this Spirit we may have as readily from
<pb facs="tcp:170387:15"/>him, as a peice of bread from the hands of our deareſt parent. Go on couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly therefore, and be confident; ſeeing there is nothing that God is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to beſtow then that which will cure us of all our griefs.</p>
            <p>Of theſe I ſhall ſay no more, and of the reſt nothing at all, leaſt I ſhould weary my other Readers, though not You, who have given me abundant teſtimony that I can do nothing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe you, and thereby laid a perpetual engagement upon me to be</p>

                  <p>That Chriſt came to diſcharge the mind of all theſe troubleſome gueſts, the Text (and many other verſes of the enſuing Chapters) plainly tell us: The ſenſe of which is this, <hi>Do but believe that I am from God, and that what I ſay is his mind, and you need not be troubled.</hi> The Faith of Chriſt is an antidote againſt all evill: Peace is the proper reſult of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

                        <hi>It is a great diſparagement to the Providence of God</hi> which rules the world. If there were no providence, I confeſs we were deſtitute of the greateſt reaſon that man hath againſt fears, and cares, and ſorrows; and he that is troubled, would be leſs unreaſonable, becauſe all the care would lie upon himſelf, and his own ſhoulders muſt alone bear the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of every accident. But ſeeing we acknowledge an eternal wiſdom, an infinite, unprejudiced under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that governs, and ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends in all affairs, it is the greateſt folly to be diſquieted, and to deport our ſelves as if we and chance ruled all. Some have ſatisfied themſelves with this ſingle thought, that it is in <hi>vain</hi> to be troubled, ſince things muſt not be as we will, but as that Almighty Being pleaſes: A cold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort one would think, to be content
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170387:21"/>upon neceſſity; and yet this ſome Heathens have mainly inſiſted upon as their ſupport. Thanks be to God that we have ſomething better for to quiet us, and that is this, That the World is governed not meerly by <hi>Gods will,</hi> but by his <hi>wiſdom.</hi> He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth all things according to his <hi>pleaſure,</hi> but it <hi>pleaſeth</hi> him to do all things for the beſt.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170387:22"/>well, or we could do better. You would think it ſtrange if the Flocks and herds ſhould make a mutinie, becauſe their Shepherd chuſes their paſture for them, and will not let them wander into wild deſarts and barren places, nor ſtray one from another, they know not whether, nor run in rank meadows and fat grounds that may breed a rot among them; and yet ſuch a thing is our trouble and vexation, becauſe we cannot do as we liſt, or are not as we would chuſe: it is a fond deſire to have the rod and the ſtaff out of the hand of the Shepherd of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and then we might ſoon walk into dangerous paths, and when we had brought our ſelves into the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of the ſhadow of death, find none at all to afford us any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
                     <p>It is diſtruſt of God to be troubled about what is to come; impatience againſt God to be troubled for what is preſent; and anger at him to be troubled for what is paſt. This tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of ſpirit finds fault with his wiſdom, and blames his goodneſs,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170387:22"/>and depreſſes his power, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends his faithfulneſs in the diſpoſe of things, and therefore it is a ſin, and ſpeedily to be amended.</p>
                     <p>To be troubled, ſpeaks as if God had provided better for the beaſts then for mankind; for they live in peace within themſelves, and we hear not of their murmurs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. And by the ſame reaſon that thou art troubled, all the men in the world may be vexed alſo; and ſo none think or ſpeak well of God, but behave themſelves as if he cared not for his rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For thou maiſt conſider that God hath endowed thee with an underſtanding of ſuch a ſize, with abilities and capacities of ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and meaſured for thee ſuch a fortune and condition as now thou haſt; if thou be not contented, but fretſt within thy ſelf that thou art not better, then ſo may another man, for he wants ſomething alſo; yea, ſo may all men, for they are all imperfect. And upon the ſame grounds that thou art troubled for the want of one particular thing,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170387:23"/>thou maiſt at the next ſtep be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that thou art not a King, or that thou art not an Angel; and an Angel may alſo be troubled that he is not a Principality, or one of the ſeven ſpirits that ſtand at the Throne of God; and one of thoſe may take it ill that he was not made to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand more, and ſo the beſt things would be moſt miſerable, becauſe they underſtand beſt their own wants. Many Arguments to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe might be heaped up from the conſideration of Gods Providence, but I ſhall only mention one more.</p>
                     <p>Gods Providence hath ſo ordered the ſeveral degrees of things in the world, that none of them ſhould be troubled, but ſhould mutually help and be aſſiſtant unto each other in their ſeveral wants; and ſo there is not the greateſt man living but ſtands in needs of the meaneſt, as much as the meaneſt doth of him; juſt as none of us can live without the beaſts, no more then many of them can live without us.</p>
                     <p>What things we want, God hath otherwayes ſupplyed us with: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170387:23"/>in ſome other kind, or elſe in that by ſome other help: Which is an obſervation that we are ſo well acquainted withall, that we are not diſcontented becauſe we need clothes, and were born naked into the world; nor do we account the beaſts have a priviledge above us, becauſe they come well clad into being, and provided with apparel for all their lives, or are armed with horns and hoofs, becauſe God hath given unto us reaſon, which is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing, and hath made them both to cloath and to arm us. Now ſo it is in other caſes; as God hath made the brutes to help us in leſſer things; ſo hath he made other men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our greater neceſſities, to comfort us in our ſadneſſes, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply us in our wants, to adviſe us in our ſtraits, and to be eyes and hands unto us, if we have no wiſdom nor ſtrength of our own: yea, his own Son hath he given to make an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal proviſion for us. Now when we ask and reſolve our ſelves, Which is better, to come into the world with clothes on our back, or to have
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170387:24"/>reaſon? we ſhould aſcend up a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle higher in our thoughts, and put to our ſelvs a parallel caſe: which is beſt? to have all in thy own hands and ſole diſpoſal, or to have a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Providence, an infinite wiſdom to govern all thy affairs? When we find the difference between theſe two, let us not live as if God ruled not at all, or as if it were better that we did rule then he.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170387:33"/>we be ſcorned and are proud, if we be leſſened in our eſtates and are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then nothing can help us from being miſerable; but on the contrary, if we do not fear death ſo much as an ill life, if we think impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and murmuring a worſe diſeaſe then the Gout; if we think pride to be the greateſt reproach and the higheſt diſgrace, and take covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be the greateſt beggary and baſeſt poverty, there is no harm a man can feel by death, or ſickneſs, or ſcorn, or want; when all the alterations in the world will not quiet us, one alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration will, and that is the change of our opinions concerning things, and our eſtimate of them: by this one, more will be done then by ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand changes. The Heathen could ſay, That no man can make another a ſlave, unleſs he hath firſt enſlaved himſelf.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Charge not thy ſelf with more then thy duty (as thoſe do who think they muſt always be at prayer, or hearing Sermons, or reading ſpiritual books, or do make raſh vows) nor with leſs then thy duty (as thoſe do who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with the obſervation of ſome precepts, or a ſeldom regard to their whole work) but labour to underſtand what God requires, and induſtriouſly labour to perform it: For it is impoſſible that either of thoſe in the extreams ſhould be at reſt; the one <hi>never,</hi> becauſe he can never do all that which he thinks he ought; the other <hi>not alwayes,</hi> becauſe his conſcience will ſometime rebuke him, and tell him that he is an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite: <hi>i. e.</hi> a partial Chriſtian. <hi>An ignorant perſon,</hi> therefore, or <hi>an idle perſon</hi> can have no true peace. We muſt be 1. inquiſitive into the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and labour to underſtand what we have to do; 2. and then reſolve
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170387:35"/>heartily, and endeavour ſeriouſly to do it all; 3. and then enquire what remedy there is if we fail and fall ſhort after theſe hearty and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious endeavours. The firſt and laſt of theſe do moſt concern our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the middle our practice. And the knowing and doing according to our knowledge, and making uſe of the Antidote when we have miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed, will keep us in peace, from that trouble <hi>which ariſes from ſin.</hi> A wicked man <hi>cannot</hi> be in peace if he underſtand himſelf; and you muſt not think that I come to preſcribe to any but thoſe who will be Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and follow him (for to ſuch the text ſpeaks) and a man of a weak underſtanding <hi>will not be in peace;</hi> therefore we muſt grow in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, if we would be without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and a Chriſtian that walks care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, without obſervance of himſelf, <hi>ought not</hi> to be in peace till he grow more watchful; and then if he be ſurprized, he knows where to take refuge: But there is no ſanctuary in Chriſt for a trifling and unguarded ſpirit, without great ſorrow, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170387:36"/>amendment, and after-care and diligence. We muſt underſtand that every indiſpoſition of body is not a ſin, and that our peace muſt not be broken, becauſe we are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the ſame temper, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo cheerfully do our duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We muſt know that a ſudden ſurpriſal, a haſty paſſion, a ſudden thought is not to break us all in pieces. And on the contrary, we muſt know that our voluntary admiſſion even of theſe, or letting of them ſtay, our not watching againſt them, and our frequent falling into that ſin, which at firſt did but ſurprize us, muſt trouble us; and there is no peace unleſs we grow better, and more ſeriouſly mind our duty.</p>
                     <p>Study therefore the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as it is contained in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and then thou wilt find there is but this one thing more to be done to keep thee in peace, <hi>viz.</hi> a careful endeavour to live as thou art direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And the ſum of the Goſpel is this,
<note place="margin">Tit. 2.12.</note>

                        <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170387:36"/>faithful and juſt to forgive our ſins, and the blood of Chriſt cleanſeth us from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi> This firſt rule I conceive will make very good way for all the reſt into our ſouls, and will have a kind of univerſal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into us upon all occaſions. We need be offended at nothing, if we have a care not to offend God. And I think he ſaid truly, who affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That there is no Joy but in God, and no ſorrow but in an evil conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As thou muſt know thy duty,

                        <hi>So labour to diſtinguiſh between thy own duty, and another mans.</hi> And this will keep thee from being troubled at the actions and carriage of men in the world towards thee and others. If men ſlight us, and deſpiſe us, and ſpeak evil unjuſtly of us, and take away our good name, yea, if they take away our eſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if we be not angry, nor filled with hatred and deſpight, nor retaliate their wrongs, then it is not we, but they that ought to be troubled: Our duty is ſecured, and therein we ſhould rejoyce. And I may take occaſion here to obſerve,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170387:37"/>that we may learn our duty by their ill behaviour, and ſtudy the more to avoid thoſe things in our ſelves, which do ſo much diſpleaſe us in others. If we be at all troubled, let it be rather for the ſin of him that injures us, then for out own ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>This rule may be put into other words, which will make it perhaps comprehenſive of more caſes. Let us conſider what is in our own power, and what is not.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing in thy own power but thy own will and choiſe; all other things are in the hand of God, or in the power of other men. It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in thy power to be handſome, or witty, or born of noble or vertuous parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why then art thou troubled about ſuch things? But it is in thy power to be good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous thy ſelf, to have a beauteous ſoul, and to be rich in good works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if thou be not thus, then thou art concerned. If mens tongues be unruly, and their hands be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and thou ſuffereſt unjuſtly by both, how canſt thou help it? Thou
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170387:37"/>art not troubled if a Dog bark, or an Aſs kick, becauſe it is their nature, and thou canſt not rule their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And here the caſe is not at all altered; for the tongues of men are as little in thy hands, as the mouthes of Dogs.

By obſerving of this rule we ſhall reap ſundry benefits. The cenſures of men will not moleſt us, becauſe it is no part of our duty that men ſhould ſpeak well of what is well done. That we ſhould have
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170387:38"/>the approbation of others, is not in our choiſe, and ſo it is not in our charge: It is not incumbent upon us that nothing we do be not miſinterpreted, and wrong apprehended. In doing well is our comfort, and in ſpeaking well of others; this let us mind, and think our ſelves no further concerned. It will keep us likewiſe from intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with other mens buſineſs, and engaging our ſelves in matters that belong not to us, which breeds men no ſmall trouble. It is our duty to do well, but not cenſure other mens doings: When the Scholars of <hi>R. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choniah</hi> asked him How he prolonged his dayes, to ſuch an age? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I never ſought my own honor by anothers diſgrace; nor ever ſpoke evill of another, and was liberal of the goods which God had given me. This was his way to live in quiet which he thought was the way to live long: but it is too common a fault among us, That we put our hands into other mens work, and ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both our ſelves and them alſo. The buſineſs of a ſubject is to obey
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170387:39"/>his Prince, and of a ſervant to execute his maſters Commands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But men fooliſhly diſturb the world, by taking upon them the authority of calling their prudence in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and finding fault with that which they have nothing to do with all.</p>
                     <p>This rids us likewiſe of curioſity, and enquiring into other mens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, or matters done abroad, which as the wiſe man notes (<hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> 7.21.) may occaſion ſome diſquiet unto us, unleſs we relieve our ſelves at laſt by this rule; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we might have found help at firſt, by not hearkening to private talk.</p>

Yea prudence will teach us to let ſome things alone, and not meddle with them, being either needleſs or elſe dangerous. As <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſaid to a

The purchaſe of peace is worth all our ſtudy, and if we can obtain it by Art and prudent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances, we ſhall find that we are gainers by our labour. Raſhneſs and violence ſometime create us more trouble then men would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have brought upon us.

Therefore if thou canſt not ceaſe complaining, I muſt adviſe thee to handle thy ſelf roughly; and when thy mind is troubled, whines and cries for ſuch and ſuch a bable, do with it as we do by children when they cry they know not for what; affright it with the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of ſome terrible thing; ſhew it the pains of Hell; ask it how it likes to burn in eternal flames, and whether it can be contented to be damned; let it ſee there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing indeed to cry for if it cannot

Reduce thy ſelf to nature and real needs, and thou wilt never be troubled about theſe matters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou wilt alwayes have what nature deſires; yea the way to have that, is not to deſire any more.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> keep it without thee.</hi> Let it not come in unto thee, nor do thou go out to it, <hi>i. e.</hi> Let it not into thy heart by love, and let not thy heart go out to it by deſire. Make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to become a piece of thy ſelf, which is without thy ſelf; For if thou loveſt any thing of which as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou canſt not be certain, thou wilt be troubled at its loſs, or at its danger. This rule may ſerve alſo to fortifie you againſt the ſame kinde of trouble (among others) for the relief of which I preſcribed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. <hi>Keep but every thing there where it is, and all is ſafe.</hi> If the world change and alter, that is nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, if it be not within us. If it have no hold of our hearts, how are we concerned in its various mutations? We ſhall never ſuffer together with the world, if it be not a part of us. But if we ſet open the door and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain it, if we embrace it, and let it dwell in us, by our love cleaving to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170387:51"/>it, then we ſhall be as it is, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can give us a remedy, but the caſting of it out again, and ſetting it where it was, quite out of our ſelves. It is a true rule, that <hi>no good can bring us any pleaſure, but that againſt whoſe loſs we are prepared.</hi> He that is in fear doth not ſincerely enjoy: and it is as true, that <hi>we ſhall have no mind to loſe that which we love dearly.</hi> Now what a miſerable caſe is this, to be troubled with fear while we have a thing, leaſt we loſe it; and to be troubled with grief when it is gone, becauſe we have loſt it? But I have taught you how to provide againſt both theſe, and againſt all ſudden ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and changes that are in the world. Keep thy ſelf as thou art. Let nothing in which is without.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Do not promiſe thy ſelf that which God never promiſed thee.</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> This heals all the evils which ariſe from vain hopes, and cools the anger of thoſe ſores which are cauſed by fruſtration of our expectations. It is lawful to deſire ſeveral things which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, if God ſee them good for us; but let us not promiſe to our ſelves
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170387:52"/>any of them. Do not entertain thy thoughts with promiſes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in ſuch a relation and ſuch a condition, nor of ſucceſs in ſuch an enterpriſe, no though thou goeſt about it wiſely: But promiſe to thy ſelf pardon of ſin, and eternal life, if thou doſt thy duty, and the grace of God to help thee for to do it, if thou pray for it and wilt uſe it: for all theſe things God hath promiſed to give us. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.11. that <hi>the race is not to the ſwift,</hi> &amp;c. but time and chance happeneth to them all: Now becauſe men know not the time when things will alter; and which is worſe, promiſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thoſe things, as if there were no time nor chance but what they fancie; therefore he ſaith <hi>ver.</hi> 12. that evil falleth ſuddenly (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſadly) upon them. Hope and fear are two great inſtruments of our trouble, and we muſt cure them both, as I have directed in this and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rule. And if we will hope for any thing, let it be (as I ſaid before) in the days of our ſorrow and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to ſupport our heavineſs, not in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170387:52"/>the dayes of proſperity, to pleaſe our fancy. We have good things enough then to comfort us; and if we will ſpend our thoughts in airy hopes, we make our ſelves miſerable two ways; We loſe the pleaſure of what we have, and never enjoy what we look for. And therefore I think he made a good anſwer, who being asked which mans grief never ceaſed, ſaid <hi>Cujus cor non acquieſcit</hi> in <hi>praeſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">— <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitum nihil ſperandi, cui adipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendo</hi> 15. <hi>perpetuis annis, max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imo labore incubui, &amp; obtinui.</hi> Cardan.</note> whoſe heart is not contented with what he hath at preſent. And he likewiſe was well imployed, who for fifteen years together with great pains endeavoured to get the habit of <hi>Hoping</hi> for nothing; eſpecially ſince (as he ſaith) he did obtain it; for no queſtion he found a great eaſe to his ſpirit by it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Think that thou art moſt angry at thy ſelf when thou doſt amend.</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Many create themſelves no ſmall trouble by being troubled at the diſorder and diſquiet of their ſpirit in croſs acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. And I give this rule to take off all that trouble which proceeds from diſpleaſure againſt our ſelves for our unquietneſs under Gods hand, or
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170387:53"/>that trouble for the ſins we have admitted, if it hinder our duty. And this indeed is oft-times the greateſt inquietude and trouble of all other. Men roll their ſouls in very vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and impatient thoughts, becauſe they were vexed and impatient, and ſo they commit that again which they ſhould cure, and unleſs they will ceaſe it, the diſeaſe will grow more deſperate. For they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient if their trouble be not cured, and their diſeaſe inſtantly healed. But alas! this which they take for the medicine is the very diſeaſe. Trouble doth but make the ſore rancle and feſter the more, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the Feavour to a greater heat; Therefore coolly and mildly ſeek to amend thy trouble by ſome of the former rules that I have propoſed. Remember the more thou vexeſt thy ſelf, the further thou art from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing healed; and like a bird that is reſtleſs in a net, thou art more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled and perplexed. Go there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeriouſly alwayes, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately about the cure, when thou art troubled at any accident, and think
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170387:53"/>that this is a ſignification of the greateſt trouble when thou art amended, and thy mind is again in peace. You may ſee how calmly <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> argues himſelf into a ſtilneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.5. <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my ſoul,</hi> &amp;c.

Let the Sun ſhine rather then the wind blow; I mean, with a clear underſtanding la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour placidly to compoſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe thy heart, and not by freſh guſts of black paſſion bluſter and rage againſt thy ſelf.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Tho. à Kemp.</note> ſaith a devout Author, A proud man and a covetous never are at reſt. The leaves of the tall trees ſhake with every breath; and no man can open his mouth to whiſper an ill word, but a proud man is diſturbed: Whereas the obſervance of this rule, will make us ſay when we are contemned and deſpiſed, that they cannot think ſo low of us as we of our ſelves, and then we ſhall not be moved. It will help us in poverty, ſickneſs and all miſ-fortunes whilſt we ſay <hi>leſs then the leaſt of all Gods mercies.</hi> Our conceit ſure of our ſelves is the cauſe that we quarrel at every thing that happens, as if we were ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable creatures that every thing muſt be done to pleaſe us, and God muſt rule the whole world accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our humour, yea and no body elſe muſt be ſerved and gratified but our ſelves. Some things there are which fall out that are good for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170387:54"/>others when they are ill for me; and therefore it is a high piece of pride for me to be troubled, as if I were ſuch a goodly thing that God ſhould mind none but me, and all creatures in heaven and in earth ſhould wait upon me, doing every thing according to my liking.</p>
                     <p>Away with this fond love of our ſelves and ridiculous over-weening. I beſeech you let us know our ſelves, and all will be well. There is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſuch poor things as we are ſhould take matters ſo ill and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly at Gods hands as we do.

That which is future is uncertain; that which is born may die; that which once was not, may again not be. What hath hapned to others may happen to me. That which hath its value from fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is not much worth. That which can be bought, cannot be great. That which can do us no harm unleſs we will, need not be feared: That
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170387:55"/>which a man can live without, he need not covet. Such like rules as theſe will the conſideration of the nature of things teach us; and then when we have learnt what they are, let us remember the uſual ſaying of <hi>Epictetus, If thou loveſt a pot, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it is a pot which thou loveſt; i. e.</hi> a thing of a baſe nature, and alſo brittle and ſoon broken, and it is no great wonder, nor no great matter if it be.

The ſum of this is; He that hath propoſed but one great end at which he levels all his actions, the obtaining of which nothing can hinder, but all things promote, and which he may alway in every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion purſue, need not be troubled.

                     <p>As we ſhould have but one end,

                        <hi>ſo let us have but one rule or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of our lives.</hi> I know you will be glad to hear what that one rule ſhould be. I know not how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it in ſhorter words then theſe; <hi>Let us alway will, and not will the ſame thing.</hi> I told you in the firſt Rule of all, that we muſt acquaint our ſelves with the Goſpel. Now let us will only thoſe things that Chriſt hath commanded, and refuſe only thoſe that Chriſt hath forbidden; and that is the principle whereby we may guide our lives, and it will never fail us. The truth is, that muſt needs be good, which a man can alwayes will; and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that any thing but what hath no evill in it, ſhould never ceaſe to be choſen by us. Let us reſolve therefore what things we will ever chuſe, and what we will ever refuſe; and for the reſt let them be as they will. Now Chriſt hath ſaid, be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, humble, meek, patient; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where hath he ſaid be rich, be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The former therefore, and not theſe we muſt alwayes will.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170387:56"/>He hath bid us likewiſe, that we ſhould not ſpeak evil of others, nor hate them, nor return their injuries; but nowhere hath he ſaid, Do not ſuffer affliction, do not put up thoſe wrongs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the former then are the things only that we muſt will not to do. And by this courſe it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt what a great way we ſhall go to the obtaining peace. For we ſhall alwayes be certain of ſomething. When a mans eſtate is gone, and his friends deceaſed, or the like, he may ſay, but I am here ſtill, and I can do what I alwayes could: <hi>Chuſe the good, and refuſe the evil.</hi> I never did will not to be poor, nor to be deſtitute of relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are other things that I make the matter of my choice; and I find that I am where I was, becauſe I can do thoſe things which are the only things which I chuſe to do. This will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie us againſt what men ſay of us. Follow Scripture and Reaſon, and let the world approve of what we do if they pleaſe. Nothing more troubles us then an ambitious deſire of every ones good word. <hi>Haud
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170387:57"/>parum artis opus eſt, ſi quis ſtulto placere velit,</hi> ſaith the Proverb among the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> He ſhall have enough to do that would pleaſe a fool. But how much trouble he ſhall have that would pleaſe no body knows how many of them, is not to be imagined. He muſt not will one thing but ten thouſand; one thing this moment, and another the next, and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable contradictions at the ſame time to pleaſe divers men. Content thy ſelf therefore with this, God is ſooner pleaſed then men; reſolve upon his will, to let that be thine and keep to it. Chuſe that which no body can hinder, no accident can forbid; if thou can not do Gods will, thou canſt ſuffer it; why then ſhouldſt thou be troubled, when thy own choice remains intire, and thou haſt what thou wouldeſt?</p>

As firſt Prayer. Secondly,

                     <p>What remains then but our hearty endeavour thus to ſettle and compoſe our ſelves? I told you at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, That theſe Rules are not like to Phyſick, that will cure us without our thoughts and conſideration: So now I muſt further remember you, that we muſt not think to take this
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170387:58"/>courſe as ſome men likewiſe do Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, juſt when the diſtemper is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, but when we are well and in quiet. When the trouble once is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and the diſeaſe hath ſeiſed upon our ſpirits, it is not ſo eaſily cured, and we cannot ſo well conſider, nor apply theſe leſſons to our minds; therefore we muſt uſe them as we do <hi>Food,</hi> which we take every day to keep us in health, and not as Phyſick, which we take but at certain times, when we find the humor ſtirring: <hi>i.e.</hi> We muſt work our ſouls to ſuch kind of reaſonings and diſcourſes as theſe are, we muſt bring our minds to ſuch a way of thinking as I have deſcribed, and make theſe rules ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to our minds, that they may be a part of our underſtanding, and a piece of our reaſon, not ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign things to which we run for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief upon occaſion of need. We muſt ſtrip out ſouls of their former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and cloath them with theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. We muſt root out theſe weeds of bitterneſs, <hi>High eſteem of our ſelves, and of worldly things, earthly love, unreaſonable deſire, fond hopes
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170387:58"/>and expectations, raſhneſs and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,</hi> and plant in their ſtead ſuch good principles as now have been commended to you, and take care that they grow up there. The government of the ſoul muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from the rule of popular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and the tyranny of fancies and imaginations, to the ſole command of Chriſtian reaſon. In this great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration let us engage all our forces. Think how ſhameful it is to get all knowledge, and not to know our ſelves, nor how to enjoy our ſelves; and how miſerable he is that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes all the world, and ſearches into all things, only neglects his own peace, or ſeeks it among the occaſions of his trouble. Diſcharge thy ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with all ſpeed of thy paſſions, of raſhneſs and haſty thoughts. <hi>Learn thy duty, do it, know God, and thy ſelf, and the world; and when thou art once humble, prudent, thankeful, and heavenly minded, thou wilt not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at what God or men do, nothing will trouble thee, or if any thing do, it will be this, that thou doſt theſe things no better, and art no more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

No joys here, like thoſe of an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous ſorrow; no cup of bleſſing ſo ſweet, as that which is mingled with tears of true contrition for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. With a good ſaying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of a wiſe Doctor among the <hi>Jews</hi> I will conclude, who ſeeing a man very ſad and ſorrowful, thus addreſſed his ſpeech to him; <hi>If thy grief be for the things of this world, I pray God diminiſh it: But if it be for the things of the world to come, I pray God increaſe it.</hi>

                  <p>This lamentation of his cannot but call to mind the tears which <hi>Achilles,</hi> another great warriour ſhed over the grave of his friend <hi>Patroclus,</hi> where <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>This love is ſuch a powerful thing, that if it have placed any object in our heart, we can ſcarce ſuffer it to be taken from us, without rending and tearing our hearts in pieces. Such a ſtrange union doth it make between two perſons, that we can ſcarce give that man any welcome that brings us the news of a ſeparation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome of the ancient <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (as I remember) knowing how hard it is to love thoſe who bring us the tidings of the death of them that we love, would never ſend ſuch a meſſage but by the hand of ſome condemned man, whom they were never like to ſee again. I am ready here to interrupt my diſcourſe, and in the very beginning to fall into a paſſion with my ſelf, when I think
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170387:62"/>how patiently we can ſuffer our ſouls to be divided from God whom we pretend to love. O love! how great things ſhould we do if we did but love! how angry ſhould we be at the temptation which would draw him from us whom our ſouls love!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Antonius Guevara</hi> had a Neece who was ſo paſſionately in love with a little Bitch, that at the death of it ſhe fell into a Feaver,
<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. pars 2a.</note> and was fain to keep her bed. The good man did well rather to chide, then to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her, and to write a Satyr, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a conſolatory letter to her; but yet in that ſtrange paſſion of hers, we may clearly ſee how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident it is unto us to take heavily the loſs of what we love.</p>
                  <p>Now there is no greater love then that which is between near kindred and friends, &amp; no man that knows the pleaſure of it, would diſſwade any from ſuch love, and yet it is neceſſary that we ſhould not mourn for it as if we loved nothing elſe; which will render it perhaps an acceptable piece of ſervice unto ſome, if I endeavour to eaſe them of this kind of ſorrow;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170387:62"/>and though I have touched but light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon other maladies (in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Treatiſe) yet I apply ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular plaiſters to this great and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſore.</p>
                  <p>You muſt not think that it is in my deſign to take away your trouble,
<note place="margin">§. 2. We may mourn mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately.</note> by taking you off from all love and friendſhip, for that would be as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous as his device to cure drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs by cutting up all the Vines. I would not have a man to love none but himſelf, out of a fear that he ſhall be troubled at the loſs of them, as much as at the loſs of himſelf. This would be to cure one evil by a greater, and to eaſe men of a ſhort trouble, by letting them want the conſtant eaſement and ſweeteſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our lives, which is our friends. Neither do I intend to write like a Stoick, and ſtupifie all your paſſions, ſo that you ſhould not mourn at all, for that is an impoſſible thing, if we have any love. Grace doth not root out nature, nor quite dry up all our tears; but it rather makes our hearts more moiſt and tender,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170387:63"/>and cauſes it to expreſs it ſelf in a becoming affection unto others: as <hi>David</hi> and that Lady may teach us. They are ſturdy, not generous, that are void of all grief: they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hard then conſtant, rather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced, then reaſonable, that forbid all ſadneſs. But it is my deſign to bring you to a moderation both in love and in ſorrow, that you may do as much as becomes good friends, but no more then becomes good men. Not to be ſenſible of evils, is not to be men; not to bear them patiently, is not to be Chriſtians. It is neither to be hoped nor to be deſired that we ſhould ſhed no tears at all; but it is both neceſſary and attainable, that we ſhould let them flow in meaſure. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crymandum eſt,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Seneca. Epiſt.</hi> 63.</note> ſed non plorandum. We may weep, but we muſt not wail.</hi> We muſt be natural, but we muſt be alſo reaſonable: We muſt approve our ſelves both to men and unto God, that they may ſee we are loving friends, and that he may ſee, we are his dutiful children. <hi>Eſt enim quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam &amp; dolendi modeſtia.</hi> For there is a certain modeſty even in mourning,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170387:63"/>and it is unſeemly to weep immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, as it is not to weep at all.</p>
                  <p>And let none think that by this conceſſion unto nature and decency, the wound will be made incurable; and that it is eaſier not to mourn at all, then to mourn moderately. Theſe are but the dreams of heavy ſouls, that think that none can ſtand ſtill, but they that are reſolved never to ſtir. It is ſaid indeed, that we may more eaſily abſtain from a thing of which we never taſted, then refrain from it after a little acquaintance. But this muſt be underſtood of pleaſure, and not of grief: When we have mourned a little, we ſhal ſoon ſee that there is neither pleaſure nor profit in our mourning. Or if any one ſhall think it to be ſome pleaſure, yet it will notwithſtanding be eaſily moderated; becauſe it is only the pleaſure of being eaſed of our loads that oppreſſed us, not of being ſatisfied with the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of any delightful object. It is but the letting out of ſadneſs, not the bringing in of any pleaſure; and therefore when the heart is once eaſed of its burden, it will ſoon
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170387:64"/>be perſwaded to mourn no more; for that will be the bringing upon us a new burden.</p>
                  <p>But then on the other ſide, as we may grant ſomething unto nature, ſo we muſt be ſure not to let it work alone. That we may weep moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it will be neceſſary to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to our ſorrows, and muſter up all the conſolatory arguments that are repoſited in our minds. Nature will do its part without our help. We need not ſtudy how to weep enough, nor uſe any arguments to perſwade our ſelves into tears. It is a ſuperfluous imployment to ſtrive to magnifie our loſs; for Fancy is apt to make it bigger then it is. It is a fooliſh trouble to be careful how to mourn, for tears will flow from us without any bidding. All our work muſt be to ſtop their paſſage as faſt as we can, and to make them flow leiſurely, not guſh forth with too great a violence. Our Reaſon and Religion muſt be called up in all haſte, to make as ſtrong a dam as we are able to our ſorrow, or elſe if it have its courſe, it may overflow us.</p>

                  <p>He is a baſe Pilot that leaves his tackling in a ſtorm, and ſuffers his ſhip to run along with the tempeſt; and no leſs ignoble and abject is his ſpirit, that permits himſelf to the guſts and Haericans of his own paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and lets them drive him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they, and not whether he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf pleaſes. But it is a degree of madneſs to uſe reaſon it ſelf to make the blaſts more terrible, and when the ſtorm is too furious, by art and skill to conjure up more boiſterous paſſions. Who would pitty him that ſets his reaſon againſt himſelf, and ſtudies how to be as miſerable as his mind can make him? We need not be ſo in love with grief, as to create it to our ſelves. Nature as I ſaid, knows how to mourn without our teaching. We had need think rather how to bear our natural trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, then how to lay more upon our ſhoulders.</p>
                  <p>But if we will make any oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we muſt begin before our paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are too ſtrong. They are too powerful of themſelves, and we muſt not let them gather more ſtrength
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170387:65"/>by our negligence. If we do not at the very firſt ſet our ſelves in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of defence againſt them, they will ſeize upon our whole ſoul, and get every thing into their poſſeſſion. As ſoon therefore as our grief ſtirs, we muſt ſtrive to comfort our ſelves, and not either help forward or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our grief. If we go and bewail our friends as much as we can, and think to chear our ſouls afterward; we ſhall ſoon find that our ſouls are drowned with a flood, and that it will be a long time before it be ſoaked up. When we give the leaſt leave to theſe paſſions, they will ask no leave of us afterward, but the ſoul will mourn like <hi>Rachel,</hi> and refuſe to be comforted. As ſoon therefore as thou heareſt of the death of thy friends, do not ſay, Alas! what a friend have I loſt! did ever any man part with ſuch a friend? where ſhall I find one comparable to him in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in love, in faithfulneſs, in all manner of ſufficiencies to make a friend? Do not, I ſay, after this ſort aggravate thy grief, but inſtantly ſay, Why ſhould I grieve and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170387:65"/>my ſelf? why ſhould I trouble my ſelf with my own thoughts? why ſhould wind and tide run together? how many reaſons have I to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented? and ſpread them all before thine eyes that they may dry up thy tears and ceaſe thy ſorrow. And ſo doing, thou wilt weep as much as is fit, but no more then thou oughtſt. Nature will be ſatisfied, and thou thy ſelf not aſhamed. None will think that thou art not grieved, and thou wilt feel that thy heart is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</p>
                  <p>But what comfort are theſe (may ſome ſay) which you bring us?
<note place="margin">§. 3. The beſt and wiſeſt perſons have not mourned much.</note> with what reaſons will you aſſiſt us?</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe it will be of no great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to anſwer, that the wiſeſt perſons have alwayes made their mourning ſhort, becauſe I have already named two both good and wiſe that were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive.

<note place="margin">Death is an uſual thing.</note> Do you not ſee that every thing in the world can cauſe death? The wind, the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the fire, the ſmoak, the duſt of the earth, the water, our meat and drink, our own paſſions, our joy, our ſorrow, and a thouſand other things can bring us to our graves. Why then ſhould it be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, as if it were ſome wonder at which all the world ſhould be aſtoniſhed? Men fill the air with ſighs, they beat the Heavens with their groans, they clothe themſelves with darkneſs, and they pour out floods as in a tempeſt. Why what is the matter? Is the Sun faln from its Orb? are all the lights of Heaven extinguiſhed? are they carrying out the worlds funeral? What is it then that cauſes this moan? A friend is dead. There is one man leſs in the world then there was. O wonderful! what a prodigy is this! One that was born to die, is dead! It had been a wonder indeed, if he had not dyed. Then we might have filled the earth with noifes. Then there had been
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170387:68"/>ſome cauſe for a tumult. But now it is rather a wonder that men ſhould make ſuch a ſtir at an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and common thing, then that a thing ſo common ſhould happen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.

                  <p>Is it not neceſſary that our friends ſhould dye?
<note place="margin">Death is neceſſary.</note> yea, it is ſo neceſſary, that it is a thing paſt, and cannot be recalled, when men weep moſt for it. If you can bring them back again with your tears, if there be any hopes that with the noiſe you make they ſhould revive to comfort you; then you have leave to weep as much as you pleaſe. Is there any <hi>Elijah</hi> or <hi>Eliſha</hi> that can ſtretch forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon them, and recover them to their warmth? Is there any <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> or ſuch great men that can raiſe them from the dead? Go then, and intreat them for to pitty you. Beat your breaſts, tear your hair, break your ſleep with ſorrow, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate your ſelves with faſting that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170387:69"/>they may take ſome compaſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. But if all this pains be loſt, never put your ſelves unto it, but ſay, Why ſhould I have my labour for my pains? And did not all thoſe men die again that they raiſed? Were they made immortal here upon the earth? what good would it do you to have them called to life again, if they muſt again dye? How would you be able to part with them then if not now? What an uncomfortable life would you lead out of fear every day to fall into the ſame ſadneſs? How deſolate would you be even in their company, unleſs you learnt not to be troubled nor diſtracted? And if that muſt be learnt, then let us learn it now when it is as neceſſary as it would be then. Do you take it ill that the Apple rots, and your trees decay, and your clothes grow bare, and that any thing in this world is according to its nature? Why then do you bewail that men die, which is as natural to them as it is to be born? Would you have God make the world anew for your ſakes? will you not be contented unleſs he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170387:69"/>make a mortal thing immortal? Is it not ſufficient that you know it muſt dye, and that he gave it to you that it may be returned to him again? Did he ever promiſe you how long you ſhould have it? may he not call for his own when he thinks good? do not other men pay this debt to nature as well as you?</p>
                  <p>Seeing then it is both a common and a neceſſary debt, do not repine as if you did only pay it? He is an unworthy debtor, that returns what is lent with a reproach to his credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.

Though God had ſaid by a Prophet, that his child ſhould die, yet he earneſtly beg'd that it might live. Men are not ſo earneſt for that which they may be aſſured God will do if it concern their ſouls, as they are for that which they have all reaſon to fear he will not do if it concern their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Men would have him recal his word, and alter his decrees in temporal matters, but they little mind the obtaining of his promiſes, and the fulfilling of his Word in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual concernments.

                  <p>And ſince death is ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing, and ſo eaſie to be met with, that every thing in the world may bring it to us; let us further conſider, that it cannot be very hurtful in it ſelf; for all ſuch things are more unufal and rare.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170387:71"/>we that mourn ſo much, have thought that death was the beſt thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals the ſons of men: And if we do not think ſo, it is becauſe we think not of death it ſelf.
<note place="margin">Plutarch. ad Apollor.</note> It is a common ſtory which <hi>Pindar</hi> was firſt Author of, how that <hi>Agamedes</hi> and <hi>Trophonius,</hi> having built the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> asked a reward of that God for their ſervice. He promiſed that after ſeven dayes he would pay them well for their pains; at the end of which they both dyed in the midſt of a ſleep.

Not long after this <hi>Pindar</hi> himſelf exemplified the ſame truth that he had taught; For when by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of <hi>Baeotia,</hi> he askt the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle What was the very beſt thing that could befal men?

                  <p>But perhaps we are not of this mind, and I need not go to an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to know the reaſon, which is plainly this; We are acquainted with no other life but this. If the world had not ſo much of our hearts, we ſhoul not find any fault with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of death, becauſe it would become deſirable. We ſhould not then be ſo ſorry for our friends depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as for our own ſtay. We ſhould be glad that neither they nor we were neceſſitated to dwell there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, where there are ſo many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that he is happieſt who is ſooneſt freed from them.</p>
                  <p>But there were many that thought not much of the goodneſs of death, who yet were comforted with the bare thoughts of neceſſity. How many Heathens might I tell you of who fled to this one truth for refuge, and found protection under it againſt the aſſaults of ſorrow? Nothing is hapned to me, but what hapneth to all. The firſt minute that we began to live, we began to dye. This is not the firſt, but the laſt moment of death. It is now finiſhed, but it

But now I think both that all things are mortal, and that their is no certain order of mortality. <hi>That which may be at all, may be to day.</hi> And if you think that your friend may die to day, then why do you not begin to mourn, ſince his death is ſo near, unleſs you mean to take it patiently when it comes? If you will lament the death of your friends ſo ſadly, why do you not prepare your lamentations, ſeeing death may be ſo near? If you think it is not ſo near, then it is likely your ſorrow will be violent when it comes, becauſe ſudden: If you think it is, and yet do not mourn, then why ſhould you lament that ſo ſadly at
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170387:73"/>night, which you did not weep for at all, at noon?
<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> There were ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they ſay in <hi>Pontus,</hi> whoſe life laſted but one day; They were born in the morning, and came to their full growth at noon, and grew old in the evening, and at night dyed. If theſe animals had been maſters of the reaſon that we have, would they have lamented after our faſhion? would they have mourned for one that chanced to die at noon, when as it could not live longer then night? No, that which is neceſſary, it is no matter when it comes. And becauſe we are of a longer life, our trouble at death is not to be the greater, but the leſs; For it is a greater wonder that we did not <hi>die</hi> many <hi>dayes agone,</hi> then that we <hi>die</hi> to <hi>day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome will ſay,
<note place="margin">The kind of death is not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable as death it ſelf.</note> that it is not death it ſelf, but the kind of death that ſo troubles them. They could have been contented, if he had gone out of the world another way. But I beſeech you, do you know what will pleaſe your ſelves? Can you tell what ſort of death it is that would content you? are there any that do
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170387:74"/>not blame their hard fortune, and wail and mourn as if none were ſo miſerable? are not men equally troubled if one dye of a Feavour, and another of a Conſumption, if their love be equal? It is very plain, that he that perſwades himſelf to part with his friends, will not grieve for the manner of the parting. He that can overcome himſelf in the greater cauſe of grief, will not ſuffer the leſs ſo eaſily to overcome him. And therefore you ſee that men have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſomething to find fault with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. If a friend die in a far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, then they ſay, Alas! that we ſhould not ſee him before he dyed! how ſad is it that we ſhould not take our leave? If he dye at home, then they ſay, who could endure to hear his groans? how ſad was it to ſee him in the agonies of death? If he die and ſpeak nothing, then they ſay, O if he might but have told us his mind, if he had left us any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances, it would have been ſome comfort. If he did ſpeak, then they tell his ſpeeches to every one, and ſay, O my ſweet child, or friend, I
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170387:74"/>ſhall never forget thy words. Would you have me put out of my mind his dying ſpeeches? and ſo thoſe ſayings are a perpetual nouriſhment and food to their grief. If he die on a ſudden, then they lament, becauſe he was ſnatch, rather then went away. If he dye of a lingring ſickneſs, then they ſay he was nothing but skin and bone, a meer Anatomy: never any creature endured ſo much as he did; and ſo they are ſad they know not for what, for they would not have had him gone away ſo faſt.</p>
                  <p>And indeed men never want ſome cauſes or pretences for their grief; but the true reaſon is, that they would not have had them to have dyed at all.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore digeſt theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations well, and ſo proceed to the next, which ſhall be this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let us conſider well who it is for whom we make our lamentations.</hi> Who is it I ſay,
<note place="margin">§. 5. II. We muſt conſider who the perſons are that die.</note> that death hath taken away from us? Perhaps it is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, a poor little weakling newly crept into the light. And this hath the leaſt of wonder in it of all other things, that ſuch a little ſpark of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170387:75"/>life ſhould be blown out.
<note place="margin">Comforts againſt the loſs of children.</note> A greater wonder it is that it was not ſtrangled in the gate of the womb. A little while ago it had no life, and it is now but as it then was. We were once content without it; why cannot we be content without it now? It never loved us, nor was capable to ſhew any affection to us, and therefore we may the better part with it. It was ſcarce tyed to our heart, and therefore it need not make the ſtrings crack. It was not unwilling to go out of the world; and if it had lived longer, death would have been more againſt its will. It hath loſt no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for it knew not the benefits of life. It hath coſt us nothing, and we have been at a ſmall charge about it, and therefore we have loſt nothing neither but only it, a coffin and a winding ſheet. If it could have known the miſeries of living, and it had been put to its choiſe, very likely it would not have choſen for to live, but to be what now it is. It hath not blotted its ſoul by any ſin, nor deflowred the Virgin purity wherein it was born. If it have any thing to complain
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170387:75"/>of, it is only this, that it was born. And therefore let us be content, for it is better perhaps for it, and not much the worſe for us. If we weep ſo much for an Infant, what ſhall we do for a man? either let us now let down the ſluce, or elſe expect that we ſhall then be drowned. If he had lived to be a man, it might have done as we do, miſerably bewail the death of its children. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either let us not bewail it, or elſe think that it is happy, that it lived not to be ſo miſerable as we think our ſelves: and both ways our grief will be cured.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe it be a child of a larger growth,
<note place="margin">Unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to mourn for one when we have more.</note> whoſe death extorts theſe tears from us. Yet it is but <hi>one,</hi> and we may have many more remaining. Shall we loſe all the content of a great many, becauſe we ſuffer the wants of one? If the life of this one would have pleaſed us ſo much, then how joyful ſhould we be in the life of four or five? If it be ſuch a grief to loſe a child, then let us be thankful that we lie not under the miſerable grief of loſing them all. But if we
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170387:76"/>cannot take this patiently, then I doubt we ſhall run mad with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, if God ſhould take them all away. We muſt learn to part with more, by parting willingly with this one, for all muſt die too. Can he bear a ſtone weight, who cannot endure the load of one pound? and yet how juſtly may we fear that all the reſt ſhould ſhortly follow, ſeeing we fret ſo much at Gods hand in this? Suppoſe that this was the moſt goodly child, yet not fairer ſure then all the reſt put together. Or if he was moſt beautiful, yet ſome of the others may be more wiſe. If this had all our love, then we may learn now how to divide our love equally, and take pleaſure in loving more. If he loved us moſt, then he would have wiſht us (if he had thought of it) not to make our ſelves miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by mourning for him.

                  <p>But let it be ſuppoſed that it is an <hi>only child;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Or when we may have more.</note> yet are there not many hopes that you may have more? who gave you this? cannot he give you another? hath not he that hath the keyes of the grave, the keyes of the womb alſo? If one die then, as long as the world laſts another ſhall be born. And if we deſire children for the good of the world, then ſo they be born, it is no matter by
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170387:77"/>whom. But if for our own ſake, then we may have them as well as others; but grief I will aſſure you is not the way to get them. Or if God will give us none, then we may adopt one. Any child will love us, as if it was our own, if it know not that it is any bodies elſe. Nay, any one will love and ſerve us for what we have, and in ſtead of one, we ſhall have many that will thank us (more then he perhaps) to be our heirs: but if we have nothing, then why ſhould we deſire children for to leave them miſerable? But as I ſaid, why ſhould we not hope for more, and thoſe better then him we loſt? So it is ſaid 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.24. <hi>David</hi> comforted <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba</hi> his wife; and how did he comfort her? he went in unto her and lay with her, and ſhe bare a <hi>Jedidiah,</hi> a man beloved of the Lord. If we count it ſuch a ſtrange thing to die, then it ſhould ſeem it is an ordinary thing to live, and ſo why ſhould we not expect the new life of another? But if it be no ſtrange thing to die, then (as I have ſaid already) we may well be comforted. Or if we ſhould
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170387:77"/>have no more, yet this may be ſome comfort, that then we ſhall have no more to mourn thus ſadly for. Yea, ſuppoſe thou art the laſt of thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and name, (as was the great <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and <hi>Lipſius</hi> alſo another excellent Scholar) it is no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſeeing the world is not to laſt long. If thy name muſt have an end, what needeſt thou to trouble thy ſelf when it ends? And if men can think it no harm to ſuffer their name to die of it ſelf (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> did who would not marry) why ſhouldſt thou be troubled if thine periſh, after thou haſt done what thou couldſt for to preſerve it?</p>
                  <p>But then if thou hadſt never ſo many children,
<note place="margin">Or when it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain whether they, or none at all be better.</note> yet who knows how they may prove? If they ſhould be bad, then thou thy ſelf wilt ſay, that it had been better they had never been. They that thou mourneſt for, becauſe they are dead, might have given thee greater cauſe of mourning if they had lived. If the death of a child be ſad, his wickedneſs would have been far ſadder, for that is a worſer death. He that dies doth trouble his parents
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170387:78"/>but ouce; but he that is bad, is a perpetual torment to them. He that is dead, cannot indeed help his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but then he doth not hurt them, as many a bad one doth. For thoſe that are dead we only grieve, we do not fear; but for thoſe that are bad we fear perpetually, and we grieve alſo: yea all the ſorrow we now conceive at their death, will not equal perhaps the meer fear which we ſhould have had from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, leſt their life ſhould be bad.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid in the life of <hi>John</hi> the patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant came to him to pray for a ſon of his that was at Sea, that he might be ſafe. Within a moneth the child dyed, and his ſhip likewiſe was caſt away. And when he was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at this double loſs, he thought one night that he ſaw the Patriarch ſtanding by his bed, and ſaying to him, Thou deſiredſt me to pray that thy ſon might be ſafe, and behold now he is ſafe, for he is dead. If he had lived wickedly in his future courſe, then he could not have been ſafe. And beſides their badneſs,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170387:78"/>ſuppoſe our children ſhould have dyed of ſome infamous and baſe death, this would have troubled us more then death it ſelf. Yea, ſome there have been that have ſought their parents death, and what a trouble would this have been? Some have ſlain their fathers, and others their mothers, and who was there left to mourn then? If you be affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at theſe ſtrange ſuppoſals (which yet ſometimes have had a real truth) yet conſider once more, that if they had not been bad, yet who knows what miſeries they might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, worſe then death? Can you tell what misfortunes might have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln them, which might have made them wiſh they had dyed ſooner? They are now dead, perhaps they have that which afterward they might have deſired, and not ſo eaſily have obtained. Who is there that deſires any one ſhould live, unleſs it be in hopes that he ſhall enjoy more good then evil? But how few are there to whom this happens, unleſs it be a fool who knows not what evil and miſery means? One of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170387:79"/>Gymnoſophiſts anſwered <hi>Alexander</hi> when he askt whether death or life was ſtronger? <hi>Life ſure, for that bears the moſt evils.</hi> And ſuppoſe he that is dead ſhould not have been miſerable; yet now he is gone, if he might riſe again, it is likely he would not, leſt he ſhould know again the fear and the pains of dying.</p>
                  <p>But it is the Death of our <hi>parents</hi> perhaps that we thus bewail:
<note place="margin">Comforts againſt the death of parents.</note> they that brought us into the world, are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves gone out of it. And what wonder is there in this? If they had not been to go out, what need would there have been of bringing us in? If they were deſigned to ſtay alwayes, then there had been no room for us. They might more eaſily remember their mortality then we; for there is no act that puts us more in mind of death, then that whereby we give another life. But it is but one of them it is likely that we have loſt, we may then love the other the more. Or if both, yet we have leaſt reaſon to complain about their death of all others; for both Nature, and they themſelves, and we alſo would have
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170387:79"/>them die before us. We complain that people die when they are young; and will we complain too when they die of old age? then it ſeems we will have none die, and cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented unleſs they live alwayes: Would they have been willing to have been left childleſs without you? if not, then they have their choice to go firſt. Or are you ſo well in love with death, that it would have been more acceptable to you to have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? or are you ſo much in love with them, that on that account you had rather have dyed then they? Then know that your death would as much more have troubled them, then theirs doth you, as the love of parents to their children tranſcends the love of all children unto them. It is very well then as it is. It is not handſome nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to complain when we are forty or fifty years of age, that our parents are dead, for they could live no longer, or if they could, it would have been but a kind of death. If we will not ceaſe to complain when we are of age, neither ſhall we ever ceaſe when we grow older. For as
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170387:80"/>
                     <hi>Cardan</hi> tells us, a poor woman once came to his door to beg an alms, and though ſhe were ſeventy years of age, yet ſhe uſed this argument in her complaints, that ſhe was a poor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs and motherleſs creature, and had none to take any care of her. We need the leſs of their care, when we can take care of our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps they die before we are of age, and can take care of our ſelves. Then we are leaſt ſenſible of their loſs; or if we are ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate as to know that, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider alſo ſuch things as theſe; There is none fatherleſs that hath God for his Father: and he that hath not, would be little better for his earthly parents. If they were good, let us follow their example, and remember their Counſel: If they were bad, they would not have been true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to us; and it is well perhaps that we had not ſuch an example to follow. They may live ſtill in us, if they were good; if they were bad, we had need live the better, and ſpend thoſe tears for their ſins (which may entail curſes on us) which we beſtow
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170387:80"/>upon them. But beſides, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by ſome, that the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſons that have been in the world did loſe their parents when they were young, or elſe it is like they had not proved ſo eminent. The great <hi>Caeſar</hi> and his ſucceſſor <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus, Alexander</hi> the Monarch of the World, <hi>Cicero</hi> the famous Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>Galen</hi> the moſt excellent Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the great Philoſopher, are all examples of this truth. If theſe had enjoyed the ſupport of their parents to lean upon, they might not have tryed their own ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, nor exerciſed their abilities; or elſe they might have been wholly eclipſed by their luſtre, and done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be taken notice of in the world.</p>
                  <p>But ſome will ſay that they have loſt one half of themſelves.
<note place="margin">— And of husband or wife.</note> Death hath raviſht an husband or a wife out of their boſoms: And it is very well too (I aſſure you) ſeeing Death is ſo common, that he hath left one half, and not taken all.

<note place="margin">And of friends. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 63.</note> do die alſo. Very true. But let me bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the words of <hi>Seneca</hi> for a leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this evil, who ſpeaks to this purpoſe. If thou haſt other friends beſides this, is it not a great reproach to them of their unworthineſs, that all of them are not able to comfort thee for the loſs of one? If thou haſt no more, then thou haſt done thy ſelf a greater wrong then God hath done thee, for he hath taken but one, and thou haſt made never an one. <hi>God makes men</hi> (as is ſaid by ſome) <hi>and we make friends.</hi> And if thou beeſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170387:81"/>deſirous of more, &amp; findeſt ſuch need of them, thou haſt leiſure now to go and ſeek them. He can never want friends, that wants not vertue. He loved not one well, that cannot love any more then one. Is it not a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous folly for a man to ſhrug and cry when he hath loſt his coat, rather then go to fetch another garment to cover him from the cold? If he be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away whom thou didſt love, ſeek another whom to love. It is far better to repair thy loſs, then to mourn for it. And if thou canſt not find another to thy mind, How couldſt thou be a friend to him that is dead, if thou haſt no power to help thy ſelf? why ſhould not a good man find enough in God and himſelf? The want of nothing, can make thee want vertue; and he that hath that, hath enough. Nay, every good man is thy friend if thou beeſt good: and they that never ſee thy face before, if they ſee thy goodneſs, they will be good unto thee.

                     <note place="margin">§. 6. III. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelves with our ſelves &amp; others, a way to be contented.</note> And firſt of all compare thy ſelf now with <hi>what thou once waſt,</hi> yea with what thou once waſt not. There was a time when thou thy ſelf was not ſo much as dead, for thou waſt not at all, nor hadſt any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of joy or ſorrow. Hath God dealt unkindly with thee in giving thee a being capable of both?
<note place="margin">We were not ſo well once, or not better; and yet not ſo grieved.</note> Would'ſt thou have reſuſed a being (if we may ſuppoſe an offer to be made to nothing) unleſs he would have given thee nothing but joy, and never taken away what he gave thee? unleſs thou haſt a mind to be nothing, be contended with what thou art. Then thou hadſt not theſe relations, for thou hadſt not thy ſelf. Why then ſhouldſt thou mourn that thou haſt them not, ſince thou haſt thy
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170387:82"/>ſelf? Is there not more reaſon to be thankful for a being, though ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of mourning, then to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the occaſion of thy mourning? Surely thou doſt not deſire to ceaſe thy mourning, by ceaſing to be. Eaſe thy ſelf then of thy mourning by the being that God hath given thee. If thou <hi>could'ſt</hi> not mourn then, <hi>Do</hi> not mourn now. But then conſider, that ſince thou hadſt a being, there was a time when thou hadſt none of theſe relations, no wife, nor chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, nor friends which thou art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of. Yet thou didſt not then weep and lament, and trouble thy ſelf as now thou doſt. <hi>Seeing thou art what thou waſt, be contented as thou waſt.</hi> What difference is there between that time and this? Thou waſt as much without then, as now thou art; why ſhouldſt thou not be as much contented now as then? All the difference between thoſe that want a thing, and thoſe that loſe it, is only this; that they who loſe it once had that, which they that want it never had. Now ſhall we be the more troubled becauſe we once had
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170387:83"/>it? one would think that their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhould be the greateſt that neither have it, nor ever had it. We have reaſon to be more pleaſed that we had it, if there were any good in it: and if there was no good in it, then we have no reaſon to be diſpleaſed that we have it not. Say, hadſt thou rather never have enjoyed thy friends, then now be deprived of them? Was thy condition worſe or better heretofore? If it was but equal to thy preſent, then thou haſt reaſon to be equally pleaſed. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how thou waſt then, and be ſo now. If it was worſe then, why ſhouldſt thou be now worſe troubled? If it was better then, why didſt thou change it, ſeeing thou kneweſt that all muſt die? No queſtion it is better to have enjoyed a good thing, then never to have known it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing thou <hi>art</hi> no worſe now then thou waſt once, but <hi>haſt</hi> been better then once thou waſt, be not more troubled then thou waſt once; yea, be leſs troubled.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">We may be worſe.</note> compare thy preſent condition with <hi>what thou mayſt be.</hi>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:170387:83"/>This is not the worſt that may befall thee in ſuch a world of miſeries. Suppoſe then that thou ſhouldſt loſe all thy children as <hi>Job</hi> did, and then loſe thy whole eſtate; that the Sea ſhould ſwallow one part, and the fire burn another, and theeves rob thee of a third, and bad debtors quite undo thee. Suppoſe after all this, that a fire ſhould begin to burn in thy own bones, and that ſhould break into boils, and they ſhould break into ſcabs, and thou ſhouldſt be poor, even to a Proverb, as that holy man was. Muſt thou not be contented then? But how is that poſſible, ſeeing thou canſt not be contented now: If ſuch a ſhowr of tears fall from thine eyes for this little loſs, then ſure thou wilt make a flood or a deluge. But what wilt thou do at laſt after all thy lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? wilt thou kill thy ſelf? Then it ſeems thou takeſt death to be the end of all troubles; and I wonder thou ſhouldſt be troubled at that which hath caſed thy friend of all troubles. Or what elſe wilt thou do? comfort thy ſelf? Try how thou
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170387:84"/>canſt do that now, for if thy ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack reſuſe cordials in this diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, never expect that it will digeſt them, when thou wilt be far more ſick and apt to vomit them up again. If <hi>Job</hi> had curſed the day wherein he was born at the firſt breach that God made upon his eſtate, what expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of grief (below a great ſin) had he left for himſelf when he ſate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the dunghil? The good man took the firſt loſſes ſo patiently, that all the reſt which befell him could not move him to greater impatience. Do thou remember him; and ſay to thy ſoul, Come, be quiet, this is not the worſt that may betide us; we have no ſuch cauſe to cry as we may have; Let us learn patience againſt a time when we may have more need of it.</p>
                  <p>And then if we ſhould be brought to the very duſt, and fall as low as the dung of the earth, yet there is another way of conſidering <hi>what may be</hi> beſides this.
<note place="margin">We may be better.</note> We may be as happy again, as now we account our ſelves miſerable. Our ſorrow may be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into joy, as our joy hath been
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170387:84"/>turned into ſorrow. Weeping may endure for a night, but joy may come in the morning, according as I have ſaid in the former diſcourſe;
<note place="margin">Job 42.12.</note> And ſo it was with <hi>Job</hi> whom God bleſſed in his latter end, more then in his beginning. <hi>We have ſeen the end of the Lord</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi>) <hi>that the Lord is very pitiful,
<note place="margin">Jam. 5.11.</note> and of tender mercy.</hi> But then this pitty of his is to be obtained only by pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. If we cannot be contented, it is needful we may think that he ſhould teach us it ſtill by greater loſſes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">We have more then we want.</note> 
                     <hi>Compare what thou haſt loſt, with what thou haſt not loſt.</hi> God leaves commonly more then he takes. He takes away thy children perhaps, but thou haſt thy husband, and he is better then ten ſons. Or if thou haſt loſt thy husband alſo, yet thou haſt thy ſelf; and why ſhould <hi>a living man complain?</hi> and thou haſt God himſelf, whom nothing can take away from thee. Or if thou haſt him not, yet thou mayſt have him; and who knows but that therefore thou haſt loſt thy friends,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170387:85"/>becauſe thou haſt not him? God hath taken them away, that thou maiſt ſeek after him. Wouldſt thou have been willing that all thou haſt ſhould have been loſt rather then this one friend? Shall God raiſe him from the dead, and all the reſt go into his tomb? Wilt thou have all, or elſe take comfort in none? Then God may well take away all, and let thee have ſomething to cry for. Yea, who is there deſtitute of all friends and comforters? <hi>Job</hi> himſelf was not ſo ſpoiled, that they had robbed him of his friends. Though they did add indeed to his grief, yet it was their miſtake, and not their want of love. And if we ſhould have no better, then we may give God thanks, that he lets us ſee more then all our friends. Yea, it is a great mercy that God gives us time to ceaſe our grief and trouble. And perhaps we have riches, and a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant dwelling, delightful walks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or if we have not, and can bear that patiently;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Barthol. cent.</hi> 4. <hi>Hiſt. An. cap.</hi> 16.</note> then we may ſoon learn how to bear this. Do the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Norway</hi> weep when they eat, becauſe their bread is made of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170387:85"/>barks of trees, and ſometimes of chaff, not of corn as ours is? If there were no trees, nor chaſſe, nor no ſuch thing to fill their mouths, they might well cry, but as long as we have what is needful, we ſhould be content, for nothing is ſo needful as that. Let us not then weep becauſe we have not ſo many friends as we had, for we have more then we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. Let us not mourn as though we were deſolate, when we want but one; no more then we do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of hunger when we have all variety of chear, except one diſh that we love moſt. But</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">We have more then many others.</note> Let us <hi>compare our ſelves</hi> (if you pleaſe) <hi>with others.</hi> In other caſes this is a thing we love to do, though there be ſo much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in it that it may undo us. If we be guilty of any fault, then we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our ſelves in compariſons, and think that we are not ſo bad as others. Now that which we are apt to do when we do ill, we ought to do when we think we ſuffer ill. Is God more unkind to us then to any of our neighbours? Do not we ſee
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170387:86"/>that many of our neighbours chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are dead as well as ours? Many of them have loſt four or five, and we have loſt but one. Nay, many of them never had any, and yet they do not therefore mourn, and beſmear their faces with tears, and break their hearts with ſighs. Our caſe is the very ſame now that we have none, but only that it is a little better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we had once ſome. And how thankful ſhould we be that we had them ſo long, if it be deſirable to have them at all? But then we may ſay further to our ſelves, How many of them have loſt their friends in the late wars? How many hath the ſword made Widdows, and the blood of how many of their children hath it drunk? Ours were taken away by the hand of God, but theirs were taken away by the hands of men. Our friends dyed in their beds, and theirs dyed in the field; Ours <hi>went,</hi> and theirs were <hi>driven</hi> out of the world. Come, let us go comfort our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that have loſt more then we, for they ſtand more in need of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. If they ſtand in need of none, then no more do we.</p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:170387:86"/>
                  <p>It was very handſomely diſcourſed by <hi>Socrates</hi> (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates) That if we could all agree to put all the troubles and calamities of men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one heap, on this,
<note place="margin">De Conſol. ad Apollon.</note> condition that after every man had brought his and thrown them there, then they ſhould all come again and take every man an equal portion of them, there would be a great many that now complain, who would rather take up what they brought, and go their ways content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them.</p>
                  <p>And ſo <hi>Antimachus</hi> an Ancient Poet, when his wife dyed whom he loved exceedingly, he went and writ a Poem bearing her name, wherein he reckoned up all the calamities that he could remember had befaln any in the world. By this means he did deter himſelf from grief; for how can one ſuffer the miſeries which others endure, if he cannot bear this light one of his own.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,
<note place="margin">It is better with us then with thoſe of former times.</note> 
                     <hi>Let us compare our ſelves with the Ancient Chriſtians.</hi> Their children were ſnatcht out of their arms by the hands of tyrants. They ſee their brains daſht out againſt the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170387:87"/>ſtones; their friends were buried in fires, or baniſhed into ſtrange places, and they had no comforters left but God and themſelves; and their chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt comfort was, that they muſt ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly die the ſame death. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, and much more, they did not take it heavily, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (as <hi>Photius</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>They bare it all thankefully,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 234.</note> and bleſſed God who could tell how to govern the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all the thoughts of men.</hi> Let not us who ſuffer but common things, weep with an extraordinary ſorrow, when they who ſuffered moſt unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural deaths did bear it with more then natural courage. They might have been allowed to have wept blood, rather then we to ſhed tears. And yet they rejoyced as if their friends had been offered in Sacrifice to God; and we weep as if they had been put to ſome ſhameful torments for their crimes. Shall we mourn more for the death of a friend then they for a butchery? What arguments had they to comfort them which we have not? What Scripture had they before their eyes to ſtay their tears,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170387:87"/>which we read not? If either of us have more to comfort us then the other, it is we; for we have their moſt excellent example. And when I think of the Mother of the ſeven Brethren mentioned in the <hi>Maca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mac. 2.7.</note> ſhe calls my thoughts back a little further then the times of Chriſt. Did ſhe wring her hands when ſhe ſaw the skin of her ſon ſtead off from his head? Did ſhe caſt any tears into the fire wherein ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them was fryed? No, ſhe ſpeaks as chearfully as if they were not ſtripping them of their skins, but cloathing them with a royal robe. She looks upon them, not as if they lay upon a pan of coals, but in a bridal bed. She exhorted them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with a couragious ſpirit, ſaying,
<note place="margin">V. 21, 22.</note> 
                     <hi>I cannot tell how you came into my womb, for I neither gave you breath, nor life, neither was it I that formed the members of every one of you. But doubtleſs the Creator of the world, who formed the generation of man, and found out the beginning of all things, will alſo of his own mercy give you breath and life again, as you now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170387:88"/>not your own ſelves for his ſake.</hi> This marvellous woman (as ſhe is called, <hi>v.</hi> 20.) knew very well that ſhe did not give them life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why ſhould ſhe take ſo heavily their death? She conſidered they were none of hers, and why ſhould not the owner take them? She knew that ſhe did not loſe them, but only reſtore them. That life ſometimes is not worth the having. That unleſs God will have us live, no wiſe man would deſire to live. That none gives any thing unto God, though it be his own, but he gives them ſomething better. And therefore ſhe ſaid, Die my ſons, for that's the way to live.</p>
                  <p>What poorneſs of ſpirit then is it, that we cannot ſee a ſoul put off her cloaths without ſo much ado? That a Jewiſh woman could ſee ſeven ſouls torn out of their body with more courage, then a Chriſtian man can ſee one ſoul quietly to depart and leave its lodging? I would wiſh every one to ſave his tears till ſome other time, when he may have ſome great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er occaſion for them. If he will weep,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170387:88"/>let it be when he ſees the bodies of his children or friends ſo mangled as theirs were. But if he would not weep out his eyes then, let him weep ſoberly, and not as if he were drunk with ſorrow now.</p>
                  <p>After we have taken this courſe with our ſelves,
<note place="margin">§. 7. IV. We muſt think with what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we weep.</note>, we ſhall be the more prepared to hearken unto reaſon. And let us proceed from making compariſons, <hi>to ask our ſelves ſome Queſtions,</hi> and ſtay till they give a good anſwer. Let us know of our ſelves why we are ſo ſad and heavy? Let us ſpeak to our ſouls, and ſay, Tell me, what is the matter? what is the cauſe of all this grief? thou art a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creature, what reaſon haſt thou for all this ſorrow? Thou art not to be pittyed meerly for thy tears, if thou canſt cry without any cauſe. Hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things appear ſometimes before us to <hi>affright</hi> us; but they are the <hi>Chimera's</hi> of a childiſh imagination, and not things really exiſtent. Let us bid fancy then to ſtand aſide a while, and let reaſon ſpeak what it is that ſo troubles us. Children cry
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170387:89"/>who cannot ſpeak, and we are not much troubled at it, becauſe they cry for they know not what; Unleſs we therefore can tell why we weep, no body will pitty us, becauſe it is not weeping that we are to mind, but the cauſe of mens weeping. Let me then propoſe theſe queſtions to be anſwered, ſome of which will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that there is no cauſe of lamentation when our friends die. And if there be no cauſe that the fountain of tears ſhould run, that is cauſe enough to ſtop it up.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>For whoſe ſake doſt thou weep?</hi> For the ſake of him that's dead, or for thy own?

Alas! he ſhall never hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger again; never be ſick again, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be vexed and troubled; and which is more, he ſhall never die again? Yet this is the frantick lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of our tears, if we weep for the ſake of him that is gone. Suppoſe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170387:89"/>thy friend ſhould come to thee, and ſhake thee by the hand, and ſay, My good friend, why doſt thou lament and afflict thy ſoul? I am gone to the Paradiſe of God, a ſight moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be beheld, and more rare to be enjoyed. To that Paradiſe am I flown, where there is nothing but joy and triumph, nothing but friendſhip and endleſs love. There am I where the head of us all is, and where we enjoy the light of his moſt bleſſed face. I would not live if I might again, no not for the love of thee. I have no ſuch affection to thy ſociety (once moſt dear unto me) that I would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change my preſent company to hold commerce with thee. But do thou rather come hither as ſoon as thou canſt. And bid thy friends that they mourn not for thee when thou dyeſt, unleſs they would wiſh thee to be miſerable again. If we ſhould have ſuch a ſhort converſe with one of our acquaintance, what ſhould we think? what ſhould we ſay? Should we fall a mourning and crying again? would it open a new ſluce for our tears to flow out? would we pray him to go
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170387:90"/>to heaven no more, but ſtay with us? would we entreate him to beg of God that he might come and comfort us? If not, then let us be well content, unleſs we can give a better reaſon for our tears, then our love to him. <hi>Holcoth</hi> reports of a learned man,

                  <p>The truth of it is, if it were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional love to him that expreſſeth theſe tears, then we ſhould not begin them ſo ſoon, nor make ſuch a noiſe, and cry when men are a dying. For the ſad countenances and the miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lamentations wherewith we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs ſick mens beds, make death ſeem more frightful to them, then it is in it ſelf. What miſery am I falling into (may a man think) that cauſes them to make ſuch a moan? What is this death, that makes even them look ſo ghaſtly who are not like to die?

No, it ſeems that you are not miſerable enough, and that makes you weep ſo much. If you had ſome greater trouble befaln you, that would put all your friends out of your mind. If you were ſick, or in pains, or had loſt all your goods, theſe things could take your mind off from this loſs; why then cannot the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them? When <hi>Joab</hi> did but threaten <hi>David</hi> that they all would leave him,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 19.7.</note> unleſs he would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, then he could wipe his face, and appear in publick as a man well pleaſed. Fear of loſing his Kingdom,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170387:91"/>put away the grief for the loſs of his ſon. And therefore let us not ſpeak of our being miſerable by this loſs, for at laſt we find it is not ſo. Yea I muſt tell you that it is not meer ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love that begets theſe tears. For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this perſon to have been at a great diſtance from us for ſome years; Did we weep and mourn becauſe he was not with us? did not the meer thoughts that he lived comfort us? was he not as good as dead when we neither ſaw, nor felt, nor heard him? What help could he afford us at that diſtance? and did we account our ſelves miſerable all that time? we are now as we were then, in all things the ſame, but only in the knowledge that he is dead. But was he not dead as to us before? did he do any thing for us at that time that he doth not now? Let us be quiet then; for the truth is, it is not love to him, nor love to our ſelves that makes us ſometimes weep, but a meer natural affection that ſtirs within us, <hi>i. e.</hi> Men mourn oft-times they know not why, but only it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſo to do. They think they are not as they were before. They feel
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170387:92"/>that there is ſomething wanting, as they imagine. It is a thing of long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance perhaps, and ſo nature is loth to part with it: Get a new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then, and that will mend all. And yet it is not meer natural affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neither that makes us ſad,
<note place="margin">For we our ſelves ſhall ſoon forget it.</note> but the freſhneſs and the preſence of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our ſadneſs. Time will make us forget it; or if our parents had dyed a little after we were born, we ſhould never have wept when we came of age, to think that they were departed. It is no hard matter then for a conſiderate perſon to ceaſe his grief, ſeeing it depends upon ſuch ſmall cauſes. And if any one ſhall ſay that it is love to the good of the world that makes him mourn for the loſs of an uſeful perſon; He hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to rejoyce that he loves the good of men ſo much. For then he will labour to do much good in the world himſelf; and he will perſwade all the friends he hath remaining, that they would do all the good they can, and repair that loſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. But let me further ask you, <hi>Was
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170387:92"/>thy friend Gods friend alſo,
<note place="margin">Our friends if <hi>Good,</hi> are not loſt.</note> or was he not?</hi> If he was the friend of God, as well as a friend of thine, why ſhould not he have his company rather then thou? If he was not Gods friend, then he could not be thine neither. No man can love us aright, that doth not love God; and if he do love God, why ſhould we think much that he goes to God? But ſuppoſing he was very dear to us; then I ſay, that if he was <hi>Bad,</hi> thou oughteſt to have mourned for him before this. For then thy tears might have done ſome good, which now are altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable.
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 22.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Seven dayes</hi> (ſaith the ſon of <hi>Sirach) do men mourn for him that is dead; but for a fool, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man, all the dayes of his life.</hi> But if he were a <hi>Good</hi> man, then thou needeſt not mourn now, for thou mayeſt hope to ſee him again, if thou art <hi>Good.</hi> Thus thou mayeſt comfort thy ſelf, My friend is not gone, but gone before. He is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from us, but not loſt. He is abſent, but not dead. He hath taken a journey into a far Countrey, and there I may go to ſee him. What
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170387:93"/>matter is it whether my friend return to me, or I go to him? None but this, that if he be in a better place, then it is better that I go to ſee him, then that he come to ſee me. Should we not deſire to be better our ſelves, and not to have him made worſe? then let us contentedly follow as faſt as we can, hoping there where he is to embrace again. We cannot expect him in our houſe, but he expects us in his. He cannot come down to us, but we may go up to him. He cannot come back, but we may follow after. And there is no difference (as I ſaid) between his viſiting of us at our home, and our going to ſee him at his, but only this, that it is a great deal better for us to ſee him there where he is, and not where we are now our ſelves. Let us not mourn therefore for that which cannot be, but rejoyce for that which may and will be. And let it comfort us that we ſhall come together again, but in a better place then we would have it; we ſhall have our deſires fulfilled, but in a more excellent manner then we deſire. And if in the mean time
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170387:93"/>he can do us any good, we may be ſure we ſhall not want it.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Ask your ſelves again,
<note place="margin">As they are not loſt, ſo we have had them long.</note> 
                     <hi>Why ſhould you mourn more for your loſs, then be glad for your enjoyment?</hi> If there be ſo much reaſon to lament the abſence of this friend, then it ſhould ſeem his enjoyment was very valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Think therefore of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thou hadſt in that, which thou wouldſt purchaſe again with ſo many tears. Is there no comfort but only in things preſent? Is it not a piece of our folly to forget what we have enjoyed? Shall we only think what delight we have loſt, and not of what we have had? We do not know whether we have loſt any, but only that which we had; and that we may think of as much as if he were alive. Of what we have enjoyed we are certain; but there is no certainty of what we ſhould have found in our friend for the time to come. Think then of the time paſt, and rejoyce that thou didſt find ſo ſweet a friend. Imagine not how long thou mighteſt have enjoyed him, but think how long
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170387:94"/>thou didſt. It was but natural to loſe him; but it was ſupernatural to enjoy him. All men are born to die, but all men are not born to live ſo long before they die. All men have acquaintance, but all men have not friends. Therefore he that hath a friend, and hath him ſo long, he is to acknowledge that God is very much his friend. He was not ours, but was given us by God; or rather he was not given, but only lent. We had not the propriety, but only the uſe. We have not loſt any thing that was our own, but only reſtored that which was anothers. And therefore now that he is taken away, we are not to be angry that God requires his own, but to be thankful, that he hath lent us ſo long that which was none of our own. And aſſure your ſelves there is nothing more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable then to mourn that God gave us a thing no longer; and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce that he gave us that which is ſo deſirable, at all. Ceaſe your tears I beſeech you, unleſs you will ſhew that you deſerved to have wept a little ſooner. Either ſay that he was not
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170387:94"/>worth the having, and then you need not weep at all, or elſe give God the thanks that you had a perſon ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and that will ſtay your immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate weeping.</p>
                  <p>Nay, will ſome paſſionate perſon ſay, but this will rather augment our grief, when we think that he was ſo much worth unto us, and yet is gone. But that is our fault, if we will think more and oftner that he is not, then that he was. How can any body help you, if you will needs look more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his departure, then upon his ſtay? Seeing there is more reaſon that you ſhould pleaſe your ſelf in what is paſt, it is to be ſuppoſed that your thoughts will be more upon it; and if they be, you cannot be ſad: But if they be not, then you are not to be cured by reaſon, but by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. When you are apt to fetch a ſigh, and ſay, Oh my dear friend is gone! call it in again, and ſay, Thanks be to God that I had ſuch an one to loſe. Who would not be willing to ſpend ſome tears after ſo much joy? But then the remembrance of the joy will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170387:95"/>that the tears do not overflow. It is an excellent ſaying of <hi>Seneca,</hi> I ever think of my friends with joy; <hi>For I had them as if I ſhould loſe them,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Habui illos tanquam amiſſurus, amiſi tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam.</hi> Epiſt. 63.</note> and I have loſt them as if I had them.</hi> If we could but think of them as dying while they are alive, then we ſhould more eaſily think of them as alive when they are dead. If we could be willing to part with them when we have them, we ſhould think that we have them, when we have parted with them. And the truth is, we cannot pleaſe our ſelves long in the remembrance of them, unleſs it be accompanyed with ſome joy. I do not adviſe you to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get your friends, and put them out of mind, but to temember them, and keep them in your thoughts. But how ſhort a remembrance (ſaith the ſame <hi>Seneca</hi>) muſt that be, which is alwayes joyned with grief and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? If we would remember one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, we muſt remember him with pleaſure; For no man will return willingly to that, which he cannot think of without his torment. And if there be any little grief intermixed
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170387:95"/>with our thoughts, yet that grief hath its pleaſure. As the ſharpneſs of old Wine doth make it more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to mens palates, &amp; as Apples are more grateful for their ſharp ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo <hi>Attalus</hi> was wont to ſay, That the remembrance of our friends is the more pleaſant, for that little ſorrow that is mingled with it.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Ask your ſelves again,
<note place="margin">And we have many more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining.</note> 
                     <hi>Why ſo many mourn for one?</hi> could that one have mourned more for you all, then every one of you do for him? If you will weep, weep only your part, and do not weep as if there was none elſe to weep but your ſelves. If a man that was not acquainted with the world, ſhould ſee ten, or twenty, or perhaps a greater number ſitting in a room, and miſerably bemoaning of themſelves, would he not ask what Town was burnt, or what family was dead that cauſed ſo many mourners? How much then would he be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed when he heard the Anſwer, that you had loſt a friend, a child, or ſome one of your other relations? What? are there ſo many tears due
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170387:96"/>(would he think) from every one of theſe for one? muſt ſo many be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to die for the death of one? can there be no comfort found among ſo many of you againſt the death of one ſingle perſon? Me thinks you ſhould all of you together weep no more for the death of one, then that one would have wept for you if you had been dead altogether. Look there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon one another, and ſay, You are ſtill left behind, and I am left, and here are twenty more of our friends alive; how is it then that we are diſcontented, as if we had not loſt one, but every one of us had loſt one? If there had been but one of us left, what could he have done more, then what every one of us doth? could he ſhed more tears for the loſs of us all, could he make himſelf more ſad then we now are? Either let us ſay, that one and ten are equal, or let us not ſhed as many tears for one as we would for ten; much leſs ten times as many tears as there would be for ten. For but one would weep for ten, and here ten that weep for one. Divide your grief then, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170387:96"/>let every one bear a part, but not the whole; for that is, as if you had none to bear it with you.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Ask thy ſelf,
<note place="margin">Or if we have not, God is ſtill ours, who rules the world, and not we.</note> 
                     <hi>Who is it that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the world?</hi> Is it the will of God, or thy will that thou prayeſt may be done? Shall not he that made a thing have leave to diſpoſe of it as he thinks good? By what law is it that he ſhall not do what he pleaſes with his own? Muſt we have our wills in all things, and muſt not he have his will alſo? muſt not he be pleaſed as well as we? If we think it ſo reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to have what we will; then it is more reaſonable that he ſhould have what he wills. Now if our will and his will cannot ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which ſhall bend and ſubmit themſelves to the other? Is not his will moſt wiſe? If he had conſidered better, would he have done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? could we have told him what would be moſt fit for us? If we had been of his Counſel, ſhould not this friend have been taken away? Doth he will things becauſe he will? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there is no reaſon at all for our
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170387:97"/>wills, and we are in love with a thing, we know not why; ſhall we think that he is ſo in like manner? Or if we have any reaſons, are not his better? We would have the life of a child that he may be a comfort unto us; God will have us to part with him, that he may be our only comfort. We ſhould chuſe his life, that he might enjoy the things that we have got: But God thinks fit that he ſhould die, that we may put our eſtates to better uſes, whereby we are aſſured he may be more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. Or perhaps we deſire our children may live for Gods glory ſake, that they may honour and ſerve him in the world: but cannot he tell what is beſt for his own glory? is he ſo careleſs of that as to take away the things without which he cannot be ſerved? Let us then ceaſe our complaints, unleſs we would have him to let us govern the World. But he was taken away, will ſome ſay, before his time, elſe I ſhould be content. I ſhall anſwer this as <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> doth,

                        <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 234.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Let me hear no ſuch word I
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170387:97"/>beſeech you, a word too bold to be ſpoken, and more bold to be thought. Before the time do you ſay? Then why was he not thought to come before the time, when he came out of his mothers womb? There is no reaſon for it but this, that it was the will and pleaſure of God that he ſhould be born at ſuch a time. And muſt God appoint the time of his birth, and we ſet the time of his death? Did the Workman give him a being in good time, and take him to himſelf, not knowing the fitteſt time? From a drop he made him to become a lump of fleſh. He formed the fleſh into parts, he brought him into the light, and he kept him in his infancy and childhood. Was any of theſe out of due time? why then only ſhould it be out of ſeaſon when he tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to another life? Let us do therefore as <hi>David</hi> did, who prayed and wept as long as he could hope the decree of God was not abſolute concerning his childs death; but when he ſaw that it was irreverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he comforted himſelf. Let us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſay as <hi>Job</hi> doth, <hi>The Lord giveth
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170387:98"/>and the Lord taketh away, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> And let this be further conſidered to the enforcing of this truth, that <hi>if the will of the Lord muſt be born, then it muſt be done.</hi> And his will is, that we ſhould take all things patiently, yea, cheerfully from his hands. And therefore if we mourn immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what do we but only add ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our pain? As there is a time to laugh, ſo there is a time to weep: but there is no more time to weep ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluouſly, then there is to laugh idly and profuſely. Both in the one and in the other we muſt be wholly ſubject to the will of God. But that will of God, as I ſaid, is very wiſe in every thing, and therefore he intends to make us laugh by this mourning; and by every ſad thing that doth befall us, to make our hearts glad. He alwayes gives ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better then he takes away, if we would but ſeek after it; and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he takes one thing away that we may ſeek after the better. But alas, our blindneſs is ſo great, that we value not that which brings us
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170387:98"/>profit, unleſs it be ſweet to our taſt. We let our paſſion judge, and not our reaſon; and therefore we think there is no good in a bitter cup, and no danger in a pleaſant draught. We lament and mourn when we ought to think our ſelves great gainers; and we rejoyce and leap, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a croſs of the greateſt burden hath befaln us. Let us ſtay a while therefore, and expect the end of things before we mourn. And let us but deſire to be cured, rather then pleaſed; to have our ſouls amended, rather then our fancy humoured; and we ſhall have great reaſon to thank God for every thing that comes to us.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. And this will lead me to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration, concerning the <hi>Goodneſs of God</hi> in all that he doth. Ask thy ſelf therefore,
<note place="margin">And he rules it better then we could do.</note> 
                     <hi>Doth not God do all things for our Good?</hi> Do we wiſh better to our ſelves then God doth? Hath not He the greateſt care of all his creatures, to ſee that it be well with them? Did he make them for any other end then that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170387:99"/>they might be happy? Is there the leaſt Sparrow that falls to the ground without our Fathers Providence? Then Mankind muſt needs be under a greater love, and none of them can die by chance, but by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. And above all other men, He hath a ſingular care over the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of good Chriſtians, the very hairs of whoſe heads are all numbered. If not ſo much as an hair can drop off without Him, much leſs can any body of them fall into their graves, but He hath a hand in it. But ſtill He hath a more ſpecial providence over ſuch Chriſtians as are fatherleſs and wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, helpleſs and deſtitute of all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour. And therefore as it was his goodneſs that took their friends away, ſo much more will his goodneſs take care of them whom he hath left none elſe to take care of. He conſiders us not only as his children, but as children placed in the midſt of ſuch and ſuch circumſtances; as deſolate and ſad, as left only to his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and tuition. And therefore it is that the Pſalmiſt ſaith,
<note place="margin">Pſa. 10.14.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is an excellent ſaying of the Royal Philoſopher <hi>Antoninus,</hi> worthy to be engraven upon our minds.

                     <hi>If there be a God, then nothing can be hurtful to us, for he will not involve us in evil. But if either there be none, or he take no care of mens matters, what ſhould I live for in a world that is without a God, or without a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? But there is a God, and he cares for men alſo, and hath put it into their power not to fall into thoſe things which are truly evil. And for the reſt that befal us, if any thing of them had been evil, he would have provided that we ſhould have been able not to have faln into that neither.</hi> But if this great perſon had known alſo that God leaves us not to our own
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170387:100"/>power, when he ſends any thing upon us, but that he hath a peculiar love to his ſervants when they are in trouble, and affords them his aſſiſtance. He would have ſaid on this ſort, <hi>If we be not alone without God, then nothing need diſcomfort us, for he is the God of all comfort. If we be alone, then we had need to be moſt diſcomforted for that, and never endure in a condition without God. But we are not alone, and we are leaſt alone when we are alone; and have him moſt, when we have other things leaſt. Therefore he hath put it into our power not to be troubled, but to go to him for comfort in all that befals us; and if there were no comfort in him for us in ſuch caſes, then they ſhould not have befaln us. Let us not therefore mourn as long as we have a God, and as long as all things make us ſeek for our comfort in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Let us ask our ſelves,
<note place="margin">Grief will end, let us end it.</note> 
                     <hi>How long we intend to mourn?</hi> Doth any man intend to continue it all his life? Then he may fall into the follies of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who made the image of his Nephew whom he dearly loved, be
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170387:100"/>placed in his Bed-chamber, that he might kiſs it and embrace it daily. Or the dotage of <hi>Alexander</hi> will be a fit puniſhment for us, who built temples, and commanded ſacred ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities every year for his beloved <hi>Epheſtion.</hi> Do you intend every year to have a funeral Sermon? to go and weep over their graves at that time, as you do when they are firſt put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them? If not, ſet ſome meaſures to your mourning, for of it ſelf it knows no meaſure. And if you intend not to weep alwaies, why can you not ceaſe now? If it be not a thing to be lamented for ever, why ſhould it be ſo ſadly lamented at all? Decency indeed doth require ſome mourning, and natural affection muſt be allowed its tears; but we muſt ſtay them as ſoon as may be, and not mourn as if we thought we could never mourn enough. For if we think ſo, then we muſt mourn alway, or elſe we ſhew that we had no reaſon to mourn ſo much. But if any man be reſolved to let the ſorrow take its courſe, and run as far as ever it can, let me tell him, that either his ſorrow will ſpend
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170387:101"/>him, or elſe it will ſpend it ſelf, and ſo be cured without any thanks at all to us. It is a trite thing which I am going to add, but (to ſpeak with <hi>Seneca</hi>) I will not therefore forbear to ſpeak it, becauſe it is ſpoken by all. So it falls out that <hi>he who will not put an end to his own grief, time will end it for him.</hi> But this is moſt diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to expect, till it put an end to it ſelf, when it can run no longer, and not to end it our own ſelves by not permitting it to run at all with our leave. To be weary of weeping is the baſeſt remedy for grief. It is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for us to leave grief, then to let it leave us. It is a ſhame to let time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer that, which hath conquered us. Seeing it muſt ceaſe, let it ceaſe by our valour and ſtrength, not by its own weakneſs. Let it die by our hands, and not meerly becauſe it can live no longer.</p>
                  <p>We are weary of nothing ſooner then of grief, and therefore let us ceaſe that, which if we would, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do long. It is well obſerved by <hi>Pliny</hi> the ſecond,

And ſeeing if it can find no comfort, it will fairly ceaſe it ſelf, it is more like men, that we ſhould comfort our ſelves and put a period to it.</p>

                     <hi>To what purpoſe is all my mourning?</hi> Every wiſe man intends ſome good to himſelf in what he doth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unleſs ſorrow will do us ſome good, it is a fooliſh thing to indulge unto it. But can any man that hath had his fill of it, tell us what ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it hath given him? May we not put all our gains in our eyes (as the Proverb is) after they have wept ſo immoderately? Doth any man ſay he is glad that he mourned ſo much? Then he had beſt mourn again if there be ſo much gladneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in it. Had we not better ſay with <hi>David</hi> concerning his child when it was dead, I ſhall go to him, but he ſhall not return to me? I may bring
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170387:102"/>my ſelf in ſorrow to my grave, but I cannot bring him up from the dead. I cannot water him with my tears, as we do a dry plant, that he may ſpring up again; but I may eaſily drown my ſelf, and learn others by my example not to weep for me. What I would not have them do for me, why ſhould I do it for another? Why ſhould I make my ſelf miſerable, and make no body elſe the better? The truth is, if there were only no good in it, it were the leſs matter, but it doth us likewiſe not a little harm. Though it will end of it ſelf, yet it may breed us no ſmall trouble before it end. This is all the comfort that ſuch a man hath, and it is a very poor one; that if his grief do not kill him,

But many an one hath grief deſtroyed; many a body hath it diſtempered; and given moſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal wounds alſo to the ſoul it ſelf. Many affections move the ſoul moſt vehemently, but none more then grief, which hath been the cauſe of madneſs in ſome (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath obſerved) and in others hath bred incurable diſeaſes, and made others
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170387:102"/>to deſtroy themſelves. And this it may do either <hi>naturally,</hi> for nothing eats the heart ſo much as grief; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing caſts ſuch a damp on the vital ſpirits as immoderate ſorrows; or elſe <hi>providentially</hi> by Gods anger, who is diſpleaſed to ſee us ſo angry and repining, and often inflicts worſe things upon us then thoſe which we cauſleſly make the matter of ſo dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful complaints. Let us therefore ceaſe that which brings ſuch troubles before it ceaſe it ſelf, and when it is ceaſed, gives us a new ſorrow, to think that we ſhould be ſo unreaſonably ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>We muſt write upon this, as well as upon inordinate joyes, <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity and vexation of Spirit.</hi> And therefore let us not be troubled now, leſt we be troubled more afterward, to conſider how fooliſhly we were troubled. The Fable of <hi>Niobe</hi> which tells how ſhe turned her ſelf with ſorrow into a ſtone, doth but ſignifie the ſtupidity and dulneſs that waits upon grief, and the exceſſive melancholy into which it ſometimes caſts us, which renders
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170387:103"/>us as inſenſible as a ſtone. Take heed how you grow in love with ſadneſs, for it hath no profit wherewithall to recompence your affection to it; but pays your folly only with it ſelf, and ſuch diſeaſes as ordinarily uſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company it. And we ſhould be the leſs in love with it, becauſe there are ſo many occaſions of it in our lives. We need not weep ſo much for the loſs of one thing, for we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect continual loſſes. The world is not ſuch a place that we ſhould take care to ſpend all our tears on one thing; we ſhall have occaſion enough for them, if we have any mind to weeping. Let us beſtow therefore the leſs upon one, becauſe there are ſo many to ſollicite our ſorrows. And if our ſouls be tender, and apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the impreſſions of dolefull things, we have the more need to comfort our ſelves, for every grief will but make us ſtill more apt to grieve.</p>
                  <p>And beſides, what a folly is it thus to die with continual grief for him, who if he did grieve to die, his grief continued but a little while: He died
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170387:103"/>but once; why ſhould we die alwayes with grief? He dyed that he might live; why ſhould we live only for to die? It is certain we muſt die, but of all deaths let us not die with grief; and much leſs for grief about that which we ſee we cannot avoid our ſelves. But let us be furtheſt of all from making our life a perpetual death, and grieving for that, which by grief we may ſo ſoon run our ſelves into.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. Ask thy ſelf again,
<note place="margin">Weep no more for thy friend, then thou wouldſt have had him weep for thee.</note> 
                     <hi>Whether two friends do not think that one of them muſt die firſt?</hi> Do we not ſee that in the common courſe of things, one man goes before another to his grave? Who then (if it had been permitted to thy choice) wouldſt thou have appointed to be the leader unto the other? Wouldſt thou have given thy ſelf the preheminence, and reſolved to have ſhewn him the way? Then Death it ſeems is a good thing; for if it were evil, we can ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thy ſelf-love is ſo little as to wiſh it might be thy portion before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And if it be good, then thou

Or wouldſt thou have had both gone together, and been encloſed in the ſame Coffin, and interred in the ſame grave? Then it ſeems it is no ſuch great mattter to die as thou makeſt it, ſeeing thou art ſo willing to die alſo. And if it be no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for thee to live, then no more was it unto him. If the ſorrow of living without him, be greater then the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of dying with him, why then was not he deſirous that thou ſhouldſt die? and why did he pray for thy life and health when he dyed? And if he would not have thee to die alſo when he dyed, why doſt thou then live in a kind of death, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeſt not thy ſelf, nor the pleaſures of life?

Are not they the moſt antient friends? is not their union moſt ſtrict and cloſe? Can two men cleave ſo together as thy ſoul em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces its companion? What then wilt thou do then when their bonds ſhall be untied, if thou canſt not bear the rupture of leſſer cords of love? What wilt thou think when thy ſoul ſits on thy lips, and gives thy body a farewell kiſs, if thou canſt not cloſe the eyes of thy friend without ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tears? Will thy ſoul mourn after thy body is dead, as thou doſt now lament the death of thy friend? Will it groan and ſigh, to think of the hole where its fleſh lies? Will it ſigh to think that its old companion is then become the companion of worms? If not, then let it not groan ſo heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a leſs matter that is now befaln it. If it will, then why art thou trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for thy friend, and not for thy ſelf, to think how ſad thou muſt one day be? The fear of thy own death,

                  <p>Doſt thou intend to go crying out of the world? If not, then be not now diſmayed at that which thou muſt bear ſo valiantly thy ſelf.

Death is no ſtrange thing (as I have ſaid) for we muſt all die. But then why ſhould we mourn ſo much, if it be ſuch an uſual thing? If we do mourn exceſſively, it is a ſign we think not of the commonneſs of it, and then how ſhall we take our own death, ſeeing we think not of it? Let us but comfort our ſelves upon ſolid grounds againſt our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and I will warrant you that ſhall cure all our other lamentations. Let us but dare to die our ſelves, and we ſhall not dare to cry ſo much for any mans death.</p>

                  <p>If thou doſt not believe his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, yet doſt thou believe the thing? Doſt thou ſeriouſly conſider that the miſery of this world is ſo great, that we ſhould rather weep that we are in it, then that others are gone out of it? Then I ask thee again, whether when thou art dead and well, thou wouldſt willingly live again? If not, then thou knoweſt what to ſay to thy ſelf concerning thy friends death. If thou wouldſt, then it ſeems thou canſt be contented with this grief; and I will not go about to comfort thee, ſeeing thou loveſt life with all the miſeries thou createſt to thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But the very truth is, we are ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of our bodies, and have ſo little
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170387:106"/>feeling of our ſouls or divine things, that it is ready to make us think we are not, when our bodies are dead. This makes death ſuch a terrible thing. This makes both our own and others death ſo heavy, becauſe it ſeems as if there were an extinction of us. That which we feel not, nor have any ſenſe of within us, it is as if it was not. And therefore if we feel not heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and perceive not that we have a ſoul, we ſhall receive death as if it was the loſs of our ſelves, and then who can but be ſad? Let us live therefore in a ſenſe of ſuch things as may make us die willingly, and think that we our ſelves are not loſt; and then we ſhall not think that we have loſt our good friends, nor lay their death ſo much to heart.</p>

                     <hi>How wilt thou be able to comfort others, if thou canſt not comfort thy ſelf?</hi> It ſhould ſeem by thy tears that thou art very ambitious of the name of a friend; but if thou be not able to comfort thy friend, what is he the better for thee? and how didſt thou

Why ſhould not that ſatisfie thee, which thou expectedeſt with ſo much reaſon ſhould ſatisfie them? What thou wouldſt ſay to another if his friend was dead, that ſay to thy ſelf. And if thou wouldſt wonder that he ſhould reject comfort, then do not make thy ſelf a wonder. Didſt thou never tell any man that it is a ſhame to be impatient, when we can cure our ſelves? that they ſuffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what God and nature have appointed; that we muſt all expect ſuch loſſes; that no body knows whoſe turn is next? Take then thy own counſel, and be not ſuch a Phyſitian as cannot cure himſelf at all. Is thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper different from theirs? are there not the ſame griefs and maladies in their mind? Then the ſame medicine will cure thee, that thou gaveſt to them. Or if it would not cure them, then thou waſt much too blame that didſt not ſeek a better both for them and thee. Or is thine ſome ſtrange

And ſo <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith of the Brother of <hi>Druſus,</hi> that though <hi>Druſus</hi> dyed in the midſt of his embraces, and with his kiſſes warm upon his mouth, thoug he dyed in the very height of his fortune, with the moſt war-like Nations dead at his feet; yet he not only put a meaſure to his own grief, but taught all the Army how to be moderate alſo. And indeed he could not have ſtopt the tears of others, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he had been of ſo brave a ſpirit as firſt to ſtop his own. If thou art a friend therefore unto any, let them all learn of thee how to be well ſatisfied. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thy ſelf as thou haſt comforted others, or elſe as thou doſt intend to comfort them. And let it be ſeen by

                     <hi>Whether friends only be mortal?</hi> Do none die but they that love us? muſt not all our enemies and they that hate us die alſo? Death then that makes thee ſad, may give thee comfort. As it puts an end to ſome comforts, ſo it is the common end of all miſeries. Though we may not wiſh for the death of any, yet it is no harm to think that they muſt die who hate us, and their rage ſhall not laſt for ever. If nothing can ceaſe their malignity, yet death can. It hath done us then no ſuch wrong, but what it can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay us with the ſame hand that did it. Though we have now no friend, yet ſhortly we may have no enemy neither. This was one ſupport to the Chriſtians under their perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that though their enemies (like <hi>Saul</hi>) did breath out nothing but threatnings and ſlaughters againſt them, yet their breath was but in their noſtrils, and might ſoon evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

                  <p n="13">XIII. And now may you not well make one queſtion more to your ſelves and ſay,

                     <hi>Is there not more reaſon to be comforted, then there is to be ſad?</hi> If there be (as certainly there is) what ſhould hinder your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, if you live by reaſon?

All that we can ſay for our ſadneſs is, that we have loſt a friend, a very dear and perhaps only friend. But you have heard that there are more in the world, and that you have not loſt this; and that you have more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts remaining then are taken away; and that if you had none but God, you had enough; and if you will read again what hath been ſaid, twenty other reaſons will offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to chear, for one that ariſes to make you ſad. If there was no reaſon at all to be ſad, then none need ſpend any time in giving of comfort: But if they be very few in compare with others, and we are made to follow the moſt and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reaſons, then he is not to be pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, who notwithſtanding the ſmall reaſon of his ſorrow, will not be of good comfort.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt cauſe that I know of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170387:109"/>this ſort of trouble, is, when many that we love die ſoon after one another. So it hapned to that Prince (which the L.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>Eſſay cap.</hi> 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Mountainge</hi> ſpeaks of) who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the news of his Elder Brothers death, whom he highly eſteemed, with a great deal of conſtancy; and ſhortly after the tidings of his younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deceaſe, in whom he placed much hope, did not alter the ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his countenance. But when one of his ſervants dyed not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, he ſuffered himſelf to be ſo far transſported, that he quitted his former reſolution, and gave up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to all grief and ſorrow. The reaſon of this was not from the love that he bare to this perſon more then the reſt, but (as he well ſaith) becauſe being top full of ſorrow before, the next flood muſt needs break the banks, or overflow all the bounds of patience.</p>
                  <p>And ſo <hi>Hier. Cardan</hi> tells us,
<note place="margin">In Dialog. cui tit. Guilielmus.</note> that after he had patiently born many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and the cruel infamous death of a ſon of great hopes; and the dangerous ſickneſs of another ſon, and the death of his parents, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170387:109"/>wife, with many other evils; yea and after he wrote a book of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation againſt all theſe evils; yet he was overcome with grief at the death of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> youth, whom he brought from <hi>Dover</hi> with him, as he paſſed from <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth. And he gives the ſame reaſon for it that the other doth, <hi>Fatigatum multis adverſis, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſit me haec extrema infaelicitas;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wearied before with many griefs, this laſt unhappineſs made me fall to the ground. It was not its ſtrength, but his own fore-going weakneſſe that made him fall. It was not heavy, but it came upon the back of many other loads, and ſo oppreſſed him.</p>
                  <p>But ſomething hath been ſaid to this alſo; For holy <hi>Job</hi> was in the ſame condition and far worſe; one meſſenger did tread upon the heels of another to bring him tidings of his miſery; and yet he was patient, though he himſelf likewiſe was in his own body moſt ſadly afflicted. We have the ſame grounds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that he had, and abundance more then was known in thoſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170387:110"/>younger times. And when one cauſe of trouble falls upon the neck of another, we can add one reaſon like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe unto another, and ſo be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted. For our troubles can never be ſo many, as the cauſes of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation are. Yea, one ſingle reaſon of thoſe that I have propounded will anſwer all. Do we not know very well that all friends are mortal? Then it can be no new thing (if we well conſider it) for two or three to die after we have loſt one: But the loſs of one doth rather mind us of the mortality of all. And doth not God govern the world in the death of the laſt as well as of the firſt? then there is no leſs wiſdom and goodneſs in it when many die, then when one. He that can ſolidly comfort himſelf in the death of one, will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately troubled for the loſs of more. If we let our grief indeed work under-ground, while nothing of it appears: if our hearts be loaded with it, though our eyes look not heavily before others, then it is no wonder if it do at laſt break forth, when the heart is over-charged, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170387:110"/>can find no other way to eaſe it ſelf. But if we take a courſe to comfort our hearts at the very firſt, and make them truly contented, or if we let not the grief ſettle it ſelf, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to diſlodge it, then we ſhall be the better diſpoſed to bear ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther croſs with the like patience. For then a new trouble doth not come upon the other, but only follows after it: It doth not adde to the former, but only comes in its ſtead; it doth not augment, but only renew our grief.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. And now is it not time to conclude theſe queſtions, and to ſay to your ſelves,

                     <hi>Why ſhould not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon do that which little or no reaſon can do?</hi> The more we are men, ſhall we be the leſs in peace, and cry like chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? Nay, children weep while they ſee their parents put into the grave, and within a day or two they forget their ſorrows; why cannot we do ſo alſo? Though they know not their loſs, yet they know not the reaſons neither why they ſhould not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented for their loſs. Though they have little underſtanding of their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, yet they have as little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170387:111"/>of our comforts and ſupports. And as for brute creatures, you ſee that they make a doleful noiſe for the loſs of their young a very ſhort while, and then they remember it no more. Some of the people of <hi>Cous</hi> (if I forget not) uſed at the age of ſeventy years either to kill their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or pine them to death, and to rejoyce much at it. They thought that they had lived long enough, and that it was both a miſery to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and a great burden to their children to have them continue any longer. The <hi>Caſpians</hi> alſo and ſome of the people of old <hi>Spain</hi> had the like cuſtom, which we well can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane and barbarous. But why cannot underſtanding teach us that, which want of underſtanding taught them? Why ſhould Barbariſm make them rejoyce at what they did them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and Chriſtianity make us ſad at what is done by God and the order of things? St. <hi>Hierome</hi> reports that in his time there was at <hi>Rome,</hi> a man who had had twenty wives, marryed to a woman who had had two and twenty husbands. There was great
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170387:111"/>expectations which of them ſhould die firſt; and when the man buryed her, his neighbours crowned him with Lawrel, and cauſed him to bear a bough of Palm in his hand, in token of a victory, at his wives funerals. It ſeems that men can ſport at death if they liſt, and laugh at that which makes ſo many cry. Why then cannot reaſon make us moderately ſad to bear that, which humor and fancy can make men not to lament at all? Why cannot our Religion do more with us, then the people or our friends, who it is like can laugh us our of our ſorrows?</p>
                  <p>If I have not ſaid too much in this argument, I have ſome confidence, that I have not ſaid too little. And indeed I have ſaid more then I firſt intended, and ſo much that if any one have the patience to read it through, me thinks the very length of the diſcourſe ſhould make them forget their ſorrows, and by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo long upon another thing, they ſhould not remember what they thought upon before. One ſoul is ſcarce big enough to hold all theſe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170387:112"/>conſiderations, and the thoughts of grief alſo. Here are ſo many that they are able to thruſt ſorrow out of doors by their multitude, if not by their ſtrength and force.</p>
                  <p>And yet notwithſtanding I muſt detain you a little longer before I give your thoughts leave to turn themſelves to other things. For I am of the mind that all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations will only aſſwage the grief, and pricking of the wound; but will not quite heal it, and take away its putrefaction. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commend two or three things, for the preſſing out all the filthy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the cloſing of the ſore, and to make the ſoul perfectly whole and ſound.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be dead to all things,</hi> and thou wilt not be offended that they die.
<note place="margin">§. 8. I. It is not their death, but the life of ſomething elſe, that troubles us.</note> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie thy ſpirit to the world and all things that are in it, and when thou haſt left them, it will be no wonder that they leave thee. Think with thy ſelf often that thy friends are dead, that thou ſeeſt them carryed to the grave, that thou beholdeſt worms
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170387:112"/>crawling out of their eyes and mouth, and try how thou art able to bear that thought. Think that he or ſhe that lies in thy bed by thy ſide, is as cold as a ſtone; think that thou embraceſt the carkaſs of thy dear friend, and ask thy ſoul how it can brook it. Think thus often, and though thy ſoul may ſtart at the firſt, yet at laſt it will be patient. That little ſadneſs will baniſh and chaſe away all the greater, that elſe would ſeize on thee hereafter. There will be little to do when death comes, if thou conſtantly doſt this. Thy ſoul will be ſo looſe from them, that thou wilt not give a ſhrike; none will bear the ſtrings crack when you are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. Death will not be a breaking of your ſociety, but a fair &amp; eaſie unty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. Nothing will happen to you but what you have looked for long before, and you will be able to ſay, This is not the firſt time that I have ſeen my dear friend dead. Yea, think with thy ſelf that thou ſeeſt thy own body laid in the grave, and that thou feeleſt thy ſelf as cold as a clod of earth. Think that thou art turned into
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170387:113"/>rottenneſs and dirt; and that thou art forgotten by thy neighbours. If thy ſoul can endure theſe thoughts, then why ſhould it be troubled at the death of another? This is a kind of death to be ſo ſeparated from thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in thy thoughts. It is all one not to be in thy body, and not to feel that thou art in it. Raiſe thy mind then up toward heavenly things; fix thy thoughts on God and the life to come; think that thou ſeeſt thy ſelf in heaven among the Saints of God; and while thy ſoul is there, it is not in thy body here below. This kind of death differs from that which will be hereafter in this only, that then thou wilt be more perfectly out of thy body. But if there be no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this ſeparation which thou now makeſt even whileſt thou art in it: There will be far leſs trouble (one would think) quite to part with it, and to get from it.</p>
                  <p>And the way to be dead to theſe earthly things,
<note place="margin">We muſt not let falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions live.</note> is, to change our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them, and to ſee them to be what indeed they are, empty and unſatisfying, changeable and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170387:113"/>Of this I have ſpoken before in the former diſcourſe, but ſeeing it is a thing ſo great and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to our contentment, let me again preſent you with it. We are the cauſe of our own grief, by mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the things of the world to ſuch a value, that the loſs of them ſhall be worth ſo many tears. We think that they are happy who are rich and honourable, though they be never ſo wicked and unskilful how to live.

If we would do thus, then that which is the cauſe of our ſorrow, would be the cauſe of our tranquillity; becauſe nothing hath left us, but that which we knew would not ſtay with us. We mourn now becauſe things are ſo inconſtant; but then we ſhould not mourn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we knew them to be inconſtant.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170387:114"/>If we could make it good that any of theſe things are ours, then I might avouch it, that they would never have left us: But if they were not ours, why are we offended, that God doth what he will with his own? And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſhall we who are ſo inconſtant, oblige all things beſides our ſelves to conſtancy? ſhall we whoſe deſires are ſo reſtleſs and uncertain, expect that all things but only we ſhould be ſtable and quiet? No, let us look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſelves, and we ſhall find ſo much difficulty to ſettle them, that we ſhall not wonder that other things are unſetled. And again, if things be ſo mutable, why ſhould we not think (as I have already ſaid) that they will one day change to what we would have them? But ſuppoſe they ſhould, what are we the better? If our opinion be not turned too, we ſhall be as much afraid to loſe them again, ſeeing they are ſo unconſtant, as now we are deſirous to have them by the benefit of their inconſtancy. We muſt therefore alter our eſteem of things now, elſe we ſhall only change our trouble, but not be rid of it,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170387:115"/>when things are changed. <hi>Adeo nihil eſt miſerum niſi cum putes, &amp;c.</hi> So certain it is, that nothing is miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but when we think it is ſo; and that nothing will make us happy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we think that we are happy.

                  <p>But if thou wilt take any comfort from the unconſtancy of things, let it be this; That if thou thinkeſt thy ſelf therefore unfortunate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe things are gone that were joyful, then thou mayſt think thy ſelf happy enough, ſeeing the things that are unpleaſant are going away alſo. And think I beſeech you once more, and be of this opinion, That there is nothing better in this world

                  <p>There was a Fable among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens which wiſe men underſtood to contain in it great Philoſophy. In the midſt of this ſad diſcourſe, it will pleaſe you perhaps, if I relate it, and it will pleaſe you a great deal more for to learn and live by it. After <hi>Jupiter</hi> had made the world, he thought that men would not be reſtrained from ſin without rewards and puniſhments; and ſo he made two great barrels, the one full of good things, the other full
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170387:116"/>of bad, to be ſent down among men as there was occaſion. <hi>Pandora</hi> being very deſirous to know what was in theſe barrels did one day broach them, and all the good things flew out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven, and all the bad towards hell. Hope only and Fear remained in the bottom of theſe Casks; the former in that of Evil things, and the latter in that of Good. When this was done, <hi>Jupiter</hi> threw down theſe empty Tubs to the earth, and all mortals ran at the rareneſs of the ſight to ſee what they could find in them. Some looked into the one, and ſome into the other, and though both of them were empty, yet they thought verily that the one was full of good, and the other full of evil. And ever ſince it came to paſs that here below we have nothing but a fancy or conceit of Good mixed with fear and jealouſie, and a meer conceit of evil, with ſome hope in the compound of it. The Moral of it is this, I hat the things of this world are but ſeeming Goods, and ſeeming evils. They are our own opinions that trouble us with the ſhadow of evil, and that flatter us on the other ſide
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170387:116"/>with a fair ſhew of Good. All real Good is in heaven, and all real miſery is in hell. If we go to heaven, we are w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Let us turn our minds then toward theſe heavenly things which they did but dream of in the dark ages of the world. Let us heartily believe the Goſpel which hath brought to light eternal life: And then we ſhall think our ſelves happy enough if we loſe not thoſe things: and perhaps the death of our friends and ſuch like croſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

There is ſcarce any thing ſo conſiderable in our bodies that is ſeen, as our tears; for they are the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table expreſſions of what is in our hearts. The hands (as <hi>Ant. Guevara</hi> obſerves) do work, the ſeet do walk, the tongue ſpeaks, but it is the heart only that weeps. The eyes are but the ſpunges of the heart, through which its affections are drained and dried up. An afflicted heart hath neither hands to labour, nor feet to walk, nor can it find a tongue to ſpeak, but tears are all that it hath to tell you what it wants. And therefore we ought to reſerve theſe for ſome greater thing then our dead friends, which our heart ought much to be affected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. As our Saviour ſaid to the women of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> when he was going to the moſt cruel ſufferings, ſo might our friends ſay to us when they are a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170387:117"/>Weep not for us, but weep for your ſelves, if you be dead while you are alive. Mourn more then you do, if you have not yet mourned for your ſins and amended them: But if you have, then rejoyce in the favour of God, and bleſs him for his Son Jeſus, who is better to thee then ten Sons, or all thy friends which thou lamenteſt. Are our ſins dead as well as our friends? have we buried them in the grave of our Lord? are we riſen again to an heavenly life? let us go then to God, and pray to him, and praiſe him, and this will give us eaſe. But if we be troubled for ſin, then ſure we ſhall not add another ſin by immoderate ſorrow, and forgetfulneſs of Gods goodneſs. If it be ſin we hate, then mourning complaints and diſcontents muſt all be hated. Would you indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe your ſelf to pray, to praiſe God and meditate in his ſacred Word? Would you render your ſelf unfit to receive the Sacrament of his moſt bleſſed body and blood? If not, then mourn but ſo much as will not hinder any of theſe, and you have leave to mourn as much as you pleaſe. Stop
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170387:118"/>but here, and there is no man will lay any reſtraints upon you. But then how ſhort your mourning muſt be, you will ſoon gueſs, and the Sun muſt not go down upon your grief, no more then it muſt upon your wrath. But if you take no great care whether you diſturb your ſouls or no, then you have moſt reaſon to mourn for that careleſneſs and neglect. Go then and bewail your unkindneſs to God, your unthankfulneſs for his mercies, and unbelief of his Goſpel; for you can never take your hearts in a better time, then when they are ſo ſad, and inclined to be ſorrowful. Tell them that now they are very well diſpoſed for a neceſſary buſineſs; and bid them look if there be not ſomething elſe to bewail that is more conſiderable. Ask thy ſelf, haſt thou not deſerved this and ten times more? Wilt thou add another ſin, when thou ſhouldſt ceaſe all ſins? Haſt thou not been careleſs of ſeeking God? Haſt thou not fooliſhly waſted thy precious time? and art thou not troubled at all for that? Yea art thou now impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, as if God dealt hardly with thee?
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170387:118"/>and wilt thou ſpend more time badly when thou art taught by the death of thy friend how ſhort it is? It is moſt incongruous thus to bewail the death of a child or acquaintance, when thou art like to die thy ſelf both body and ſoul. And when thou haſt mourned for thy ſins, thou wilt be taught there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by how little thou oughteſt to mourn for thy loſſes. For even our tears for ſin muſt not be immoderate, and therefore much leſs muſt we dare to let them flow in abundance for our loſſes. So you know the great Apoſtle commands the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to comfort him that had been guilty of a great ſin, and receive him again into the Church now that he repented, <hi>leſt perhaps ſuch an one ſhould be ſwallowed up with overmuch ſorrow,</hi> 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2.7. I wiſh all thoſe who are ready to deſtroy themſelves with grief, would ſeriouſly confider this, that we may not over-load our hearts with grief for our ſins themſelves, which are the cauſes of all other ſorrows.</p>
                  <p>We cannot pleaſe the Devil better then by diſcontent. He would fain oppreſs every good man with ſome
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170387:119"/>paſſion or other; let us take heed how we joyn with him againſt our ſelves. If we have left his ſervice, that is enough to provoke him. If we have bid defiance to his pleaſures, this doth incenſe him, and we muſt expect that he will endeavour to overcome us with griefs.</p>
                  <p>The Devil is mad againſt all good men; and therefore let all thoſe who have irritated him againſt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware how they now prove cowards, and execute his vengeance for him with their own hands. Let us take heed (as <hi>Photius</hi> excellently expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it) leſt we be good at ſtirring up and provoking the envy and rage of our adverſary, but naught at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting and overcoming him by pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and perſeverance to the end. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>But if we muſt needs weep for the loſs of ſomething here, let it be for the afflictions of the people of God. Let us mourn to ſee the Church ſit like a widdow in her black garments. Let it pitty us to ſee the blood of Gods ſervants ſhed like water upon the ground. If our own ſins do not
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170387:119"/>trouble us, let us weep to ſee the wickedneſs of the world, and let our eyes run down with tears, to think that men do not keep Gods Law. Some ſuch channel we ſhould cut for our tears, and not let them ſpend themſelves on this faſhion about our own perſonal troubles. This is a method both to ſtop our tears, and likewiſe to make them uſeful to us while they run. It is a way to eaſe us of our preſent grief, and of all others alſo. We ſhall exchange that ſorrow that would have troubled us, for a great deal of joy and comfort. Whereas our worldly grief would have left the heart ſad, this will leave it light and merry.</p>

The Body it ſelf doth not die any more then corn doth, which dies, that it may live and ſpring up again with large gain and advantage.

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170387:120"/>expect till the harveſt comes? Why ſhould we then bury our friends with ſo many tears, ſeeing they are but laid in the womb of their mother again, that by the power of God they may have a better birth. The Heathen could ſay much to comfort themſelves, but they knew not this comfort; for indeed they were rather <hi>contented</hi> then <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</hi> Thoſe that did think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt wiſe, and judged that they had the beſt ſupports, did only dream that the ſoul might take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther body, and ſhift its place at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times: But we know that there will be a time, when even our ſcattered aſhes will fly into one anothers embraces again, and a new life will breath into our duſt, and make it ſtand upon its feet. And then in the mean time if our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be never ſo ſad, and we be left all alone, why do we not ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace our ſelves in the great compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our High Prieſt, who hath a feeling of all our miſeries which we endure? Can we expect that ever he ſhould love us more then when
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170387:120"/>we are like unto him in ſufferings? We ſhould be ſo far from being ſad at what befalls us, that we ſhould think, if our condition was a little worſe, we ſhould be more dear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him then now it is when nothing extraordinary is hapned to us. No man can be alone as long as he lives who hath ſaid, I will not leave you comfortleſs like fatherleſs children, I will come to you. Did not he bid his Diſciples to be well content, when he himſelf dyed? Did he not leave his peace with them, and bid them that their hearts ſhould not be troubled? And what is the death of one of our friends, to the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the beſt friend to the world that ever was from his little flock of friends? Did not Chriſt know what he ſaid, when he was going to die? Did he adviſe them not to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, when it was impoſſible that they ſhould be otherwiſe? And if they were not to be troubled then, I am ſure we have leſs reaſon to be troubled now; both becauſe we have a leſs loſs to bewail, and we have a ſtronger and more excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170387:121"/>againſt our loſs. Our friends are as much below him, as his ſtate in the grave was beneath that to which he is now advanced in the Heavens. Their hearts were not to be troubled when He that is the Lover of the world was held in the chains of death, becauſe they knew that he would looſe them; Why then ſhould we be diſturbed for the death of one that loves us only, when we know that Chriſt is riſen, and that he is in the Heavens, Angels, Authorities, and Powers being made ſubject to him. If an Angel was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for our comfort, we ſhould not want his Miniſtry. He is ſo full of love and compaſſion towards us, that if he did not think he had left Cordials enough to ſupport us, he would come himſelf to chear us, and raiſe our friend, as he did <hi>Lazarus,</hi> from the dead. But now we may well live in hope, and he hath given us ſtrong conſolation and good hope through grace. Let us have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience but a little, and we ſhall not be capable of mourning any more; All tears ſhall be wiped off from
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170387:121"/>our eyes, ſighing and ſorrow ſhall fly away.</p>
                  <p>Remember then I beſeech you,
<note place="margin">§. 9. Let no man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be in love with tears.</note> whoſoever you are that caſt your eyes on theſe lines, what I ſaid at the beginning. Take heed you do not indulge your ſelves in your tears. <hi>Eſt enim &amp; dolendi quaedam ambitio,</hi> for there is a certain ambition even in mourning, and men think that they ſhall be the better thought of for their grief. But aſſure your ſelves, that if we ſtudy to exceed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in grief, it is but juſt with God that we ſhould never want miſery enough, ſeeing we are ſo ambitious of it. If we will mourn immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he would have us to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; we ſhall not keep our ſelves patient when perhaps there is little or no cauſe to mourn. When the air is diſpoſed to rain, it is a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can recover fair weather; and every little cloud will fall a weeping, which at another time would have been dry and barren. And juſt ſo it is with thoſe that ſtrive to gather as many clouds as they
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170387:122"/>can to overcaſt them, and make them ſad. It is ſo long before they can diſperſe them all, that every little thing renews their grief, as if a chearful day ſhould never ſhine upon them more.</p>
                  <p>It was a very handſome device that one of the Ancient Philoſophers uſed to comfort <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> when he obſerved her to weep immoderately for her ſons death. Let me intreat you ſaid he, to lend me your patience till I tell you this ſtory: On a time <hi>Jupiter</hi> conferred honour upon all the leſſer Gods or divine Powers, and there was none of them wanting but only Sorrow. When all the reſt were gone away rejoycing, ſhe came and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſome honour alſo with many tears and intreaties. <hi>Jupiter</hi> having conferred all honours that were worth any thing upon the other Heavenly Powers, He granted to her all that which men beſtow upon their dead friends (<hi>viz.</hi> grief and tears) as beſt befitting her quality. Now all theſe little Deities (ſaid this wiſe man) do love thoſe moſt that love and honour them, and ſo doth Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170387:122"/>alſo. They beſtow moſt of their gifts on their Votaries, and thoſe that pay them conſtant ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and they care not for thoſe that obſerve none of their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. If you therefore beſtow no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon Sorrow, then ſhe will not love you nor come to you. But if you ſtudiouſly ſeek how to pleaſe her, and honor her by tears and lamentations, and all ſuch ſad things that are the offices wherein ſhe delights, ſhe will be in love with you, &amp; you ſhall never want her company, nor be without occaſions of doing continual honour to her. She will be continually ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying thee with tears to pour upon her Altar, and filling thee with ſighs, which are the incenſe which ſhe loves thou ſhouldſt evaporate toward Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. By this Art the wiſe man ſtaid her tears; for ſhe knew that he meant, that if we give way to grief, we ſhall never want it: and much more, if we ſeek for arguments to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate it, it will ſtick ſo faſt unto us, that it will never forſake us. Though love and reſpect to our friends, and the natural affection
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170387:123"/>which diſtinguiſheth us from beaſts, do allow and require a moderate, ſorrow and contriſtation of our ſpirit; yet an intemperate grief and afflicting of our ſouls is <hi>unreaſonable;</hi> for it doth <hi>them</hi> no good; and it is <hi>unnatural;</hi> for it doth both our body and mind abundance of harm; and let me add likewiſe, that it is <hi>unchriſtian,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues that we have little hope in God either for our ſelves or others. God hath done us the honour to make us Prieſts unto himſelf; and you know it was the law for the Prieſts,
<note place="margin">L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>v. 21.</note> that none of them ſhould mourn for a dead friend, unleſs he was of their neareſt kindred, And therefore let us take heed how we make our ſelves unclean for the dead, by weeping, ſo that we ſhould unfit our ſelves for any Chriſtian ſervice, which God hath appointed us for our conſtant imployment. Can you mourn and praiſe God too? Can you pour out your ſouls to God, while you pour out theſe tears of grief? Can you pray in faith for other things, and not be able to believe that you can live without a friend? Can you read
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170387:123"/>ſeriouſly, when your eyes are ſore with the ſharpneſs of your ſorrow? Can you meditate of heavenly things, while your thoughts are filled with the images of ſuch doleful objects? If not, know that you defile your Prieſthood, and that you muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly clenſe your ſelves, that you may be fit continually to offer up ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritnal ſacrifices unto God.</p>
                  <p>And for a concluſion of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, remember what I ſaid in the former Treatiſe,
<note place="margin">He muſt write theſe things in his heart, who would find the comfort of them.</note> That you muſt lay theſe foundations and grounds of comfort within your ſelves, or elſe you will alwayes be troubled. It is ſomething within us that muſt ſatisfie our minds, and not the enjoyment of any outward good; and therefore we muſt work theſe principles into our hearts; for even <hi>they</hi> if they be without us, will not profit. We either think that it is the thing that we want which will cure us, when as it is without us; or elſe that we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons enough to comfort us, when as alas! we want them alſo, becauſe we let them lie without us, and have them not in our minds. We have
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170387:124"/>more wayes then one to abuſe and deceive our ſelves. At firſt we think that if we had what our hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire at this preſent, we ſhould never be diſquieted: And when by reaſon and experience we find it otherwiſe, then we make a great many good principles upon which to reſt our ſouls; but they are at a great diſtance alſo from our hearts; and when we ſhould uſe them, they are none of our own no more then any thing in this world.</p>
                  <p>Let theſe two things then ſettle themſelves in our minds, which will lead us into the right way of fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſouls both againſt this and all other trouble. Firſt, Never <hi>think that the things which thou wanteſt will cure thee;</hi> for they will rather make the wound wider, and inlarge thy wants. The more we have, the more we deſire ſtill to have; and the way to think we have enough, is not to deſire to have too much. It is very well obſerved by <hi>Plutarch,</hi>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170387:124"/>ſhift our cloaths to make us cool. Juſt ſo do men think, that the things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them will afford them content; and that if they had a ſumptuous houſe, and had riches at command, and were encompaſſed with ſervants, and had their friends to bear them company, they ſhould live moſt ſweetly and deliciouſly; when as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teaches us, that we are ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of ſome change in one thing or other about us. It is the heat of our own bodies that keeps us warms, which our cloaths do only contain, and keep in that it may not fly abroad, and diſperſe in the air; and ſo is it the livelineſs and ſtrength of our own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that muſt make us live merrily, and which gives all the pleaſure and grace to theſe outward things which mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to our comfort. They can only help to maintain and increaſe our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; but our delight muſt ariſe from a more certain cauſe within our ſelves. Add one heap of riches to another, build great houſes, invite to thy ſelf friends and lovers; unleſs thou doſt free thy ſelf from thy own deſires, unleſs thou doſt put an end
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170387:125"/>to thy fears and cares, and ſuch like things, thou doſt but like him that adminſters Wine to a man in a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, or Honey to a Cholerick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or meat to him that is troubled with the Collick, which do not ſtrengthen, but deſtroy them. The leſs we have, the better it is, unleſs we deſire but a little. And therefore it is of abſolute neceſſity, that we form to our ſelves ſuch ſtrong princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as will moderate our deſires and make them reaſonable. But then let me tell you in the ſecond place. <hi>That a good book, and a Treatiſe of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Contentment may be without us as well as any thing elſe.</hi> We think that we have good reaſons of being quiet which will comfort us upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. But where are they? In our Books? That is no more ours, then our money that bought it, unleſs the book be in our heart. We muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to write theſe truths on our ſouls, and turn them into the reaſon of our minds. <hi rend="margQuotes">Things of faith we muſt make as if they were things of reaſon: and things of reaſon we muſt make as ſenſible as if they
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170387:125"/>beat continually upon our eyes and ears.</hi> Let us colour and die our ſouls with theſe notions, or elſe they will do us but little good. If this book lie by us, and not in us, it will be little better then waſte paper.

When they are eaten and drunk, they turn into fleſh and blood, into bones and nerves, and make us luſty and ſtrong: but when they lie by us, we only ſeem to have them, but they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us no nouriſhment or refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all. Even ſo it is in theſe things; If we inwardly digeſt them and turn them (as it were) into the ſubſtance of our ſouls, they will make us of a lively complexion; but elſe we may be pale with fear and pine away with grief; and it is not their fault, but our own. And as he that doth not eat when he ſhould, may have no ſtomack when he is weak, but preſently vomit up his food again: So he that minds not theſe things till he be ſick of his troubles,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170387:126"/>and in great need of comfort, will find his ſoul (it is moſt likely) very impatient of the remedy; and it will be a trouble to him but to read that which will quiet him.</p>
                  <p>Meditate therefore ſeriouſly of what hath been ſaid.
<note place="margin">A recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation of the chief things that have been ſaid.</note> Think that you are not loſers by your friends gains, and that there is no reaſon to be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful when they are filled with joy. We love our ſelves indeed better then we do them, and are troubled at our own loſs, not at theirs; but then if the loſs be our own, we can tel better how to repair it. That is our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that it is in our own hands to eaſe our ſelves, if we be the cauſe of our own trouble. Conſider often that it is as natural to die as it is to be born: That God gives us every thing upon this condition, that we ſhould be content to give it up again when be pleaſes to call for it. That God is a loving Father, and doth every thing for the beſt, That he would have us love <hi>him</hi> more, when he leaves us nothing elſe to love. That nothing can be ſad, which by his grace and our care may be turned into joy.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170387:126"/>That we ought to turn our ſorrow into care, leaſt there be ſomething worſe to ſorrow for, even the ſin of out immoderate ſorrow. That we ought to live ſo, that we may comfort our ſelves with hope we ſhall ſee our friends again that die in the Lord. That ſeeing we muſt die too, and others muſt weep for us, by our life we muſt leave them ſomething to comfort them in hope that we are better, then if we were with them. We muſt often conſider how much of our grief depends on meer fancy, and not on things. We were perhaps at a great diſtance from our friends while they lived, and did but ſeldom ſee them. The caſe is not much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered now that they are dead. If we have ſuſtained a loſs, we do but double it by loſing our own quiet and comfort alſo. And yet there is more cauſe of thankfulneſs then of repining; both that we had them ſo long, and alſo that God hath taken away only them. Our grief at laſt muſt ceaſe; and that which will end it then, may end it now. Or if it muſt end it ſelf by it its own
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170387:127"/>wearineſs, it is a ſhame that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions reaſon cannot do more then meer length of time can doe. It is but as we our ſelves would have it, who would have been loth to have died firſt. Or elſe it is as they would have it, who would have been loth to have out-lived us, and been ſo ſad as we make it neceſſary for to be. They are not quite gone away, but only gone before. And by ſorrow we may tread too faſt upon their heels. Let us henceforth place our chiefeſt comfort in God; for if one be taken away, then ſo may another. There will be every day new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of trouble; and unleſs we be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter provided againſt it, we ſhall be every day miſerable. This world is the place of ſorrow; and therefore ſeeing there are things enough to trouble us let it not be our work to create trouble to our ſelves. Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is a thing that will come without our call; but true joy will not ſpring up without our ſelves. If any ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſhould oppreſs us, it muſt be for our ſins. And when we mourn for them, let us be ſorrowful we were
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170387:127"/>no more thankful for ſuch enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as we have now loſt. And laſtly, Let theſe tears teach us to take off our affections from worldly things, all the pleaſure of whoſe poſſeſſion is ſcarce big enough to compenſate the trouble of parting with them.</p>
